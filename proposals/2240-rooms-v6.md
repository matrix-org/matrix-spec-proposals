# MSC2240: Room Version 6

A new room version, `6`, is proposed using [room version 5](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v5.html) as a base
and incorporating the following MSCs:

* [MSC2209](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2209) - Including notifications in power level auth rules.
* [MSC2432](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2432) - Alias event authorisation and redaction.
* [MSC2540](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2540) - Integers in canonical JSON compliance.

Though other MSCs are capable of being included in this version, they do not have sufficient implementation to be
considered stable enough for v6 rooms. A future room version may still include them.

Room version 6 upon being added to the specification shall be considered stable. No other room versions are affected
by this MSC.
