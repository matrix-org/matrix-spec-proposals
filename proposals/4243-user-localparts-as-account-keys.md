## MSC4243: User ID localparts as Account Keys

User IDs should be public keys because:
 - User IDs as they are today are direct personal data. For [GDPR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/342)
   reasons we would like to be able to remove direct personal data from the immutable append-only DAG. This proposal
   replaces user IDs with indirect personal data.
 - As user IDs are user controlled, spammers set their localpart to abusive messages in order to harass and intimidate others. Redactions
   do not remove the user ID so these messages persist in the room.

This follows the wider pattern of IDs becoming cryptographic primitives:
 - Event IDs were converted to SHA-256 hashes of the event JSON in [MSC1659](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1659)
 - Room IDs were converted to SHA-256 hashes of the create event in [MSC4291](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/matthew/msc4291/proposals/4291-room-ids-as-hashes.md)

Furthermore, we would like to remove the need for servers to sign events with their federation signing
key to:
 - improve the security of the federation API by reducing split-brain opportunities,
 - [improve the robustness](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3121) of the client-server API.

Several proposals already exist to do this, notably [MSC4014: Pseudonymous Identities](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4014)
and its parent [MSC1228: Removing mxids from events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1228).
However, these proposals drastically alter one of the fundamental data types in Matrix. This has a
negative effect on the (particularly client) ecosystem as they need to update their code to handle the changes.
This was seen in [MSC4291: Room IDs as hashes of the create event](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4291)
which removed the `:domain` part of the room ID. Furthermore, both of those MSCs suffer from scope creep: MSC4014 had per-room per-user keys, and MSC1228 had room keys complete with new `^` and `~` sigils. 

Instead, this proposal solely addresses the problem with allowing direct personal data in the user ID and using the server signing key to sign events, taking care to keep the user ID format compatible with the existing ecosystem. This makes the proposal very light, and easier to implement incrementally on top of the existing Matrix ecosystem, whilst leaving room for per-room per-user keys or client-controlled cryptographic keys in the future.

### Proposal

Starting in room version `vNext`:
 - User ID _localparts_ in rooms are replaced with an ed25519 public key: an "Account Key".
   Leaving and rejoining the same room MUST NOT change the _account key_. The _account key_ is encoded as unpadded
   urlsafe base 64. An example _user ID_ is: `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:matrix.org`.
   TODO: MSC1228 versioned this with a `1:` prefix. Should we do the same? How would you even relate the same user across multiple versions anyway?
 - The private key for this _account key_ signs the event JSON over federation. This means servers do not need to make
   any network requests to verify the signature on inbound events. Currently servers need to ask for the server keys of
   the domain directly or via a notary server. If they cannot get the server keys, the event is dropped, causing a split-brain.
   This is why this proposal improves the security of the federation protocol. NB: The private key still lives on the server, not clients.
 - The domain part of the user ID is kept for compatibility and to provide _routing information_ to other servers.
   Servers still determine which servers are in the room based on the domain of the user ID.
   
Signatures on an event follow the same format as today for backwards compatibility with existing server code, but the key ID is now the urlsafe base64 encoded public key:
```json
  "signatures": {
    "matrix.org": {
      "ed25519:l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ": "these86bytesofbase64signaturecoveressentialfieldsincludinghashessocancheckredactedpdus"
    }
  }
```

Terminology for the rest of this proposal:
 - Account Key: the ed25519 public key for the user's account.
 - Account Name: The human-readable localpart today e.g `alice`.
 - Human-readable User ID: user IDs as they exist today, formed of an account name and domain e.g `@alice:example.com`
 - Account Key User ID: user IDs of the form `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:matrix.org`, formed of an account key and domain.
 - Localpart / Domain: segments of a user ID as they are defined today. 'Localpart' is ambiguous and should be qualified as 'human-readable' or 'account key'.

>[!NOTE]
> Naming is a famously hard problem. The term "Account Key" was chosen for a few reasons:
> - Accounts are heavily implied to live server-side which matches the storage location of this key.
> - It implies the key is user ID scoped, which it is (as opposed to room / device scoped).
> - It isn't a term used in Matrix today (unlike Master Key, User-Signing Key, Self-Signing Key which are all cross-signing keys, or Sender Key which is used in E2EE)
> - As the key is per-user, it doesn't imply unlinkability of the key between rooms (unlike Pseudonymous Identities).
> - It provides reasonable flexibility for extensions to the key e.g if they become per-room, a 'Pseudonymous Account Key' works well.
>   If the key moves client-side, a 'Local Account Key' also works as a descriptor, even combined as a 'Pseudonymous Local Account Key'.

In order to map the account key to a user, servers will ask the domain-part of the user ID for information about the
account key via a new bulk federation endpoint:
```js
POST /_matrix/federation/v1/query/accounts
{
    "account_keys": [
        "l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ",
        "EgdGx+0oy/9IX5k7tCobr0JoiwMvmmQ8sDOVlZODh/o",
        "cWm64pdXOGz1DbIXTuH+24szY/+9HjPP7jZwbDjn12s"
    ]
}
```
Returns:
```js
200 OK
{
    "account_keys": {
        "l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ": {
            "account_name": "kegan",   // The account name. The 'localpart' of a user ID today.
            "domain": "matrix.org", // The 'domain' of a user ID today.
            "signatures": { ... }   // This JSON object is signed with the account key to allow changes in the account name/domain to be detected.
            // This JSON object is extensible. In the future we could add:
            //  - Profile info e.g displayname, avatar_url
            //  - Per-room keys info e.g room_id
            //  - 3PID info e.g email_address (could this replace 3PID invites?)
        },
        "EgdGx+0oy/9IX5k7tCobr0JoiwMvmmQ8sDOVlZODh/o": {
            "account_name": "matthew",
            "domain": "matrix.org",
            "signatures": { ... }
        }
    }
}
```
 account keys are omitted from the map. Like all federation requests, this request _is authenticated_ using the server's signing key.
This creates a bidirectional link:
 - By signing event JSON, the account key claims to belong to a particular domain. This is embedded into the DAG.
 - By responding to the endpoint with that account key, the domain claims to own that particular account key. This is not embedded into the DAG so not all servers will agree on this.

The server receiving this response SHOULD persist the mapping in persistent storage. The `account_name` MUST NOT change upon subsequent
requests for the same account key.[^1] When a user is created on a server, the account key SHOULD[^2] be created and SHOULD[^3] be kept immutable for the lifetime of that user. There is a chicken/egg problem for some federation operations e.g invites,
as clients will invite the `account_name` to a room, and will not know the account key yet. Specifically, any federation operation which acts on another server's user needs to talk to that server to discover the account key mapping. To aid this, the following adjustments are made:
 - `/_matrix/federation/v2/invite`: The sender sets the `state_key` of the invite `event` to the human-readable user ID (as we do today), which the receiver then replaces with an account key user ID when signing the invite event. The sender then signs this JSON, creating the double-signed event.
 - A new endpoint `/_matrix/federation/v2/ban` is created, which is identical to `/invite` but for pre-emptive bans when the account key is not known. Omits the `invite_room_state` field.

>[!NOTE]
> A few designs were considered here, including having a generic bulk lookup function to map **from account name** to account key.
> A generic bulk lookup function would be prone to abuse as malicious servers could enumerate the relatively small namespace of account
> names to discover all the accounts on any server.
>
> Considering the chicken/egg problem only exists for invites and pre-emptive bans, it feels acceptable to keep the scope small and

>
> An alternative design would be to exclude the `/ban` endpoint entirely, making it impossible to do pre-emptive bans in room version `vNext`.
> In practice this works well with moderation tooling (e.g Mjolnir, Draupnir) which instead reactively ban the user if they join a moderated room, rather
> than flooding the DAG with thousands of potentially unnecessary ban events. This would mean the chicken/egg problem would exist solely for invites,
> which would then mean a simple modification to the `/invite` API is enough.

#### Server behaviour

When a server joins a room, it will receive a list of account keys that are joined to the room. No external requests need to be made in order to verify
the event signatures of the DAG or to apply auth rules, thus ensuring that all servers will converge on the same room state.

The server SHOULD group each key according to its claimed domain and perform a single `/accounts` query to fetch the human-readable account name for each
account key. This SHOULD be done prior to sending the room information to clients. Based on the result of the query, the server should then group
account keys into three categories:
 - Verified: the domain is aware of the account key because it was contained in the response. The JSON in the response has been correctly signed by the account key.
 - Unverified: the domain is unaware of the account key because it was not contained in the response. This indicates that the account key is lying about its `:domain`.
 - Unknown: the domain is unreachable, returned a non 2xx status, or the server cannot decode the response body.

This proposal tries to avoid clients needing to know or care about these account keys. As such, it takes steps to replace the account key
with the account name in the user ID where possible in event JSON sent to clients/bots/bridges/appservices. For a given account key `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:matrix.org`:
 - The server should replace the account key with the account name in the user ID for verified keys. E.g `@kegan:matrix.org`.
 - The server should replace the `domain` of the user ID with "invalid" for unverified keys. E.g `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:invalid`.
 - The server should prefix the account key with `_` when the domain is unreachable. E.g `@_l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:matrix.org`.

>[!NOTE]

Once a mapping has been verified or unverified, it can be permanently cached. An  mapping should be periodically retried until it is either verified or unverified. Servers should time out requests after a reasonable amount of time in order to ensure they do not delay new rooms appearing on clients.
If a client has been told an __ account key user ID which then subsequently becomes verified / unverified, the server MUST:
 - resend the `m.room.member` event for all rooms with that account key user ID, replacing the user ID sections appropriately.
 - issue a synthetic leave event for the  account key user ID for all the rooms with that user ID.

This ensures the member list remains accurate on clients. State events sent by that account key user ID MAY be resent with an updated `sender` field.

#### Gradual compatibility

To enable clients to gradually become aware of account keys, servers MUST set the `unsigned.account.key` property of the event JSON to be the account key
and the `unsigned.account.name` property of the event JSON to be the account name returned from `/accounts` e.g:

```js
{
    // .. event fields
    "unsigned": {
        "account": {
            "key": "@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:matrix.org",
            "name": "kegan",
        }
    }
}
```

Clients can then use the `unsigned.account.key` field as an unchanging identifier for the sender of the event, akin to how they use the `sender` field today.
A later room version can then:
 - Revert the `sender` of the event to be the wire-format over federation and not modify it, meaning the `sender` becomes identical to `unsigned.account.key`.
 - Tell clients to form the user ID by replacing the account key with the `unsigned.account.name` if it is present. The absence of a `name` means the
   key is not verified. Abusive `name` strings can be redacted by the server without breaking user identification.

This is slightly more wasteful on bandwidth, but provides much more convenience for clients as the data they need is in the same struct.

#### Impacts on end-to-end encryption

Device lists are fetched based on the user ID over federation via `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/user/devices/{userId}`. This MUST continue to use
the human-readable account name form of the user ID. This means if a server is unable to map an account key to an account name, it will be unable
to fetch device lists for that user and E2EE will break. This is reasonable because servers are in general only unable to perform the mapping if
the remote server is unavailable, in which case E2EE will break anyway.

>[!NOTE]
> This is done in order to not break cross-signing keys, which sign the `user_id`. This will be signed with the Human-readable User ID.

#### Impacts on restricted rooms

Rooms with the `restricted` join rule are impacted because we no longer want to check that the server domain signed the event. Thankfully, the `join_authorised_via_users_server` field is a _user ID_, so we can simply extract the account key from the localpart of the user ID and verify that there is a signature with that key. For clarity, auth rules are modified like so:

> If type is `m.room.member`:
> - [...]
> - If `content` has a `join_authorised_via_users_server` key: 
>    * If the event is not validly signed by the ~~homeserver of the user ID denoted by the key~~ account key denoted by the user ID, reject.

#### Impacts on key validity

It is critical that all servers agree on which events have valid signatures and which do not. As a result, key validity as a concept is untenable if we wish for all servers to converge because the key validity time can be modified inconsistently for different servers. As a result, this MSC _removes_ the [Signing key validity period](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/rooms/v5/#signing-key-validity-period) introduced in room version 5.

The impact of this is that a compromised private key cannot be cycled by setting an expiry time for it. Instead, the server should:
 - Generate a new account key for this user.
 - For each room that user is joined to, invite the new account key to the room.
 - Join the room with the new account key.
 - Transfer any power level rights (NB: creatorship cannot be transferred, so this will be imperfect).
 - Leave the room with the compromised key.

This is best-effort and there are numerous limitations to this approach: predominantly the compromised key may be able to backdate themselves back into the room due to the self-revocation.

TODO: if we are serious about this, we should probably introduce some kind of recovery key semantics instead of a validity period, but this feels like massive scope creep.

### Potential Issues

Servers may lie about their domain e.g `foo.com` may join the room as `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:bar.com`.
This means `foo.com` will not get events in the room routed to them, but a victim server `bar.com` will instead be pushed events as a form of amplification attack.
Servers MUST have a global backoff timer per-domain to ensure that attackers cannot repeatedly join users with fake domains to popular rooms to cause amplification attacks.

### Security Considerations

- Servers can equivocate and tell some servers that account key A has the account name "alice" and tell other servers
  that account key A has the account name "bob". This doesn't affect the security of the protocol _from a server perspective_
  as the account name is simply a user alias at this point for clients. However, _from a client perspective_ this makes it
  harder e.g to establish pre-emptive ban lists as you cannot be guaranteed that banning the account name "alice" will actually
  prevent alice from joining the room. This requires dishonest servers to achieve however, so can be addressed with server ACLs
  (banning the dishonest server from participating in the room).
- Servers can masequarade as users on their server, but they could _already_ do this due to the lack of any end-to-end
  cryptographic signing of events.
- If another domain gets hold of the private key to an identity, they can manufacture valid events with that key
  e.g `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:matrix.org` => `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:evil.com`.
  As the domain is not checked when verifying events, this will pass event signature checks. However, this is a new identity at
  a protocol level since the domains are different and as such the user must be allowed to join the room before their events will
  pass event authorisation checks. Alternatively, a stolen identity could manufacture valid events with that key _and domain_.
  At this point, the event will be indistinguishable from a non-stolen identity. However, the attacker will not be sent events in
  the room due to their domain not being present in the domain part of the user ID. The attacker would need to additionally
  compromise DNS in order for events to be sent to them, or have an existing stooge server joined to the room.
- Servers could ignore the requirement to keep the account key constant for each user. This would allow ban evasion,
  but this is also possible today with server collusion.


### Alternatives

We could move to per-room per-user keys like MSC4014 does. Unfortunately, that makes several things harder. Performance is worse
because every key needs to be queried with the remote server, scaling O(nm) where n=number of users, m=number of rooms rather than
O(n) like this proposal does. Extra protocol complexity is required in order to pre-emptively resolve the mappings without requiring additional
network requests _for authorised servers_ (e.g [key blinding](https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-signature-key-blinding/draft-irtf-cfrg-signature-key-blinding.html)).
This has knock-on effects because the inability to retrieve the underlying user identity can break E2EE and cause the end-user
to see ugly user IDs which can't be mapped to any human-readable identifier. Assuming these problems could be addressed, this proposal
would require no extra changes to support per-room per-user keys as it would just result in more `/accounts` requests to servers. 
It is technically possible with this proposal alone for some servers to use per-room per-user keys and some servers to use per-user keys.
Care must be taken to ensure that any "aggregate" operations which intend to operate on a user across all rooms use the account name and
not the account key (e.g like fetching device lists for a user).

### Future work

We want to eventually support portable accounts, where a user can migrate seamlessly to a different server. This would require the
_client_ to store the account key, not the server. The underlying identity string would need to drop the domain to support this e.g
the `sender` of the event would have to just be the key, without the domain. It has to do this otherwise when you migrate to a different
server, the domain of the `sender` will be wrong and critically will never be able to be updated without creating a new identity from a
room protocol perspective, and thus will have the wrong permissions. Alternatively, we could keep the domain and adjust the auth rules to
only use the public key to determine identity, meaning `@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:foo.com` and
`@l8Hft5qXKn1vfHrg3p4+W8gELQVo8N13JkluMfmn2sQ:bar.com` would be treated as the same user from a room permissions perspective. Both options
are invasive: one changes the user ID format and the other subverts the existing room permission model that clients have been coded to expect
(which can be particularly painful to change, see [MSC4289](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4289) as an example).





### Unstable prefix

- The room version is `org.matrix.12.4243` based on room version 12.
- The `/invite` and `unsigned` properties do not need prefixes as they are already room-scoped, and the room is prefixed.
- The endpoint `/_matrix/federation/v2/ban` is `/_matrix/federation/v2/org.matrix.12.4243.ban`.
- The endpoint `/_matrix/federation/v1/query/accounts` is `/_matrix/federation/v1/query/org.matrix.12.4243.accounts`

### Dependencies

This MSC has no dependencies.

[^1]: Because the JSON with the `account_name` and `domain` is signed, we could use transparency logs to detect when a server
tells some people one account name and other people a different account name. In addition, it opens up the possibility of having
trusted notary servers provide the JSON in the event that the server is unavailable. Notary servers would be trusted to perform
the federation requests honestly, and only return the JSON for account keys which have a correct `domain`.
[^2]: Servers are allowed to lazily create account keys on usage.
[^3]: Previous iterations of this proposal had this be 'MUST', but by dropping it to 'SHOULD' we informally bless servers that wish
to add additional privacy protections for their users via per-room per-user keys, in which case there will be multiple account keys
for the same underlying account.
