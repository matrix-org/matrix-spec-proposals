# MSC3768: Pin messages to Rooms

## Proposal
I would like to be able to pin messages to a Room, similarly to how this can be done on Discord. 

Pins are useful for pinning important information in formal Rooms, or pinning your favorite/funniest messages in the Room that you share with friends.

## Potential issues
- There is the possibility that this feature would cause too much clutter in Matrix clients if not enough people intend to use it
- This may be prone to spam/raids if it is not easy to set proper permissions for who can pin messages
