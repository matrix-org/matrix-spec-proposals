# MSC3944: Dropping stale send-to-device messages

Matrix allows devices to send messages [directly to other
devices](https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging).
This is used in end-to-end encryption, such as for sending keys, and performing
device verification.

However some devices, particularly those that are offline for an extended
period of time, accumulate many to-device messages that become stale.  This can
impede normal operation of the device when it comes back online: servers only
send a limited number of to-device messages in each call to `/sync`, so a
device with many to-device messages waiting for it may require several calls to
`/sync` in order to, for example, receive the Megolm sessions needed to decrypt
in-room messages.

We propose to allow servers to drop to-device messages that are no longer
needed: room key, secret, and verification requests that have been cancelled,
and verification requests that are too old.

## Proposal

Servers may drop the following to-device messages from a device's inbox:

- `m.room_key_request` with `action: request`, if there is a corresponding
  `m.room_key_request` message with `action: request_cancellation` and the same
  `request_id` and `requesting_device_id` fields, sent by the same user.  If
  the request message is dropped, the cancellation message is dropped as well.
- `m.secret.request` with `action: request`, if there is a corresponding
  `m.secret.request` with `action: request_cancellation` and the same
  `request_id` and `requesting_device_id` fields, sent by the same user.  If
  the request message is dropped, the cancellation message is dropped as well.
- `m.key.verification.request`, if there is a corresponding
  `m.key.verification.cancel` with the same `transaction_id` field, sent by the
  same user.  If the request message is dropped, the cancellation message is
  dropped as well.
- `m.key.verification.request` when the `timestamp` is more than 10 minutes in
  the past.  Since clients are to ignore verification requests that are older
  than this, they can be safely dropped.  The server may wish to remember the
  `transaction_id` and sender for some time, so that it can also drop the
  `m.key.verification.cancel` message with the same `transaction_id` and
  sender, if such a message gets sent.
- `m.room_key_request`, `m.secret.request`, or `m.key.verification.request`
  messages (along with any corresponding cancellation messages, if any), where
  the `requesting_device_id` (in the case of `m.room_key_request` and
  `m.secret.request`), or `device_id` (in the case of
  `m.key.verification.request`) refers to a device that no longer exists.

## Potential issues

None.  The messages that are dropped are messages that clients would ignore
anyways.

## Alternatives

We could just do nothing.

## Security considerations

This requires the server to inspect to-device events, but this is something
servers are already capable of doing, so this does not introduce any new
security issues.

## Unstable prefix

No new event types or endpoints are introduced, so no unstable prefix is
needed.  This is just a change in behaviour.

## Dependencies

None
