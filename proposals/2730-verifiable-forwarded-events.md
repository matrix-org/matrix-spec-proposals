# Verifiable forwarded events
This is an alternative to [MSC2723](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2723)
that handles the issue of faking forwards.

## Proposal
The proposed solution is copying the entire federation event data, which allows
recipients to validate the signatures even if they are not in the origin room.

As clients generally don't have access to signatures nor any way to validate
them, both sending and validating require server support. Sending is
implemented as a new endpoint, while validating happens automatically and the
server adds the validation result to the top-level `unsigned` object.

### `PUT /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomId}/event/{eventId}/forward/{targetRoomId}/{txnId}`
This endpoint requests the server to find `eventId` from `roomId` and forward
it to `targetRoomId`. The `txnId` behaves the same way as in the `/send`
endpoint. The request body has an optional `decryption_keys` field that will be
copied to `content`->`m.forwarded`->`unsigned` in the resulting event when
present. The content of the `decryption_keys` object varies based on whether or
not the target room is encrypted, see the "Encrypted events" section below.

Only unredacted message events can be forwarded. If the given event ID is a
state event, a redaction or a redacted message event, the request will be
rejected with a standard error response using the code `M_NOT_FORWARDABLE`.

If the generated event is too large, the request is rejected with a standard
error response using the code `M_TOO_LARGE`. Before rejecting the request,
servers MAY check if the event would be small enough without the profile data
in `unsigned`, and send the event without that data if it is.

Similar to the `/send` endpoint, this endpoint returns an object containing the
`event_id` of the forwarded event.

#### Generating forwarded event
To forward an event, the server creates a new event with the same event type
and normal top-level fields. To determine the content, the server has to
inspect the content of the source event:

* If the source event was already forwarded from some other room, the `content`
  should simply be copied with no modifications. This means that an event
  forwarded many times will only remember the original source, not any hops it
  made on the way.
* If the source event was not a forward, but contains (invalid) data in the
  `m.forwarded` key, the request will be rejected with `M_NOT_FORWARDABLE` like
  other unforwardable events. This limitation also can be used to intentionally
  mark messages as unforwardable (e.g. `"m.forwarded": {"allow": false}`).
* If the source event does not contain `m.forwarded` at all, the server must
  generate a new one. After generating the object, it is placed in `content` of
  the new event along with everything from the `content` of the source event.

##### Generating `m.forwarded` object
`m.forwarded` is an object that contains all the top-level keys of the source
event, except for `type`, `content` and `unsigned`. The following keys are
therefore at least required:

* `auth_events`
* `prev_events`
* `room_id`
* `sender`
* `depth`
* `origin`
* `origin_server_ts`
* `hashes`
* `signatures`

The following keys may also be present:

* `prev_state`, may be present as an empty array even in non-state events
* `event_id`, only in v1 and v2 rooms

Additionally, the server MUST include an `unsigned` object, containing a
`room_version` field that specifies the version of the source room. The server
SHOULD also include the sender's profile metadata in the unsigned object under
the fields `displayname` and `avatar_url`.

### Receiving events with `m.forwarded`
When a server receives a message event that has the `m.forwarded` key in its
`content`, the server MUST use the data to validate the signatures, then add a
`m.forwarded` key to the top-level `unsigned` of the event with the validation
information.

#### Validating signatures
To validate a signature, the server should start with the `m.forwarded` object
and modify it as follows:

* If the object is missing any of the required keys, mark it as invalid without
  trying to validate it.
* Remove the `unsigned` key (if present).
* Copy `type` from the top level into `m.forwarded`.
* Make a copy of the top-level `content`, remove `m.forwarded` and put it in
  the `m.forwarded`.
* Using the result object, validate the signature, calculate the reference hash
  and check the content hash of the event as specified in sections 26.2 through
  26.4 of the server-server specification: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.4#validating-hashes-and-signatures-on-received-events

#### Unsigned `m.forwarded` object
For any message event with `m.forwarded` in the content, the server MUST add or
override the `m.forwarded` key in the `unsigned` object of the event. The key
MUST be an object that contains the keys `valid` and `event_id`.

If the `m.forwarded` object was valid and the signatures were validated, the
`valid` value should be `true`. In any other case (invalid signature, bogus
data, etc), the value should be `false`.

In v1 and v2 rooms, the `event_id` is copied from the `m.forwarded` object in
`content`. In v3 and up, the `event_id` is based on the reference hash that was
calculated in the previous section. Copying the event ID in v1/v2 rooms is for
convenience of clients: they only need to look in one place regardless of the
room version.

### Encrypted events
In some cases, users may want to forward encrypted messages to rooms with users
who are not in the origin room. In order to allow everyone in the recipient
room to decrypt the forwarded message, the keys must be sent with the message.
However, only keys for the message being forwarded should be sent, any other
messages in the origin room must not be decryptable with those keys.

To achieve this, the user forwarding the message includes the message-specific
symmetric AES and HMAC keys (see [Message encryption] in the Megolm spec). Each
of the keys are encoded as unpadded base64 and placed in the `aes_key`,
`hmac_key` and `aes_iv` fields in the `decryption_keys` object in the forward
request.

[Message encryption]: https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/blob/master/docs/megolm.md#message-encryption

When forwarding encrypted messages to encrypted rooms, the `decryption_keys`
object is encrypted the same way `content` would be in normal messages.
Recipient clients should check which fields are present in the `decryption_keys`
object to determine whether or not it is encrypted.

The decryption keys should be included even if forwarding a message to the same
room, as there may be new users in the room who didn't receive keys to old
messages.

## Client behavior
Clients SHOULD NOT trust forward metadata in the event content without an
explicit `"valid": true` in the unsigned `m.forwarded` object. Additionally,
clients SHOULD make sure the server supports this proposal before trusting
forwards even if the `valid` flag is present.

Not trusting forward metadata does not necessarily mean it must be completely
ignored. For example, clients could render the event as a forward, but include
a notice saying it's unverified.

When receiving forwarded encrypted events, clients should treat the message
like they treat forwarded keys, i.e. not confirmed to originate from the user.

Clients may discourage users from forwarding encrypted messages to unencrypted
rooms, as that would leak the message content to the servers.

## Potential issues
* This is not as simple as MSC2723 and requires server support.
* Events with bogus data in `m.forwarded` can't be forwarded.
* Events that are close to the 64 KiB size limit can't be forwarded. MSC2723
  has the same problem, but this proposal has even more extra data. The amount
  of extra data in both proposals is rather low (<1kb), so this should not be
  a problem in practice.
* Encrypted events forwarded to other rooms won't be decryptable. Clients
  should probably either prevent forwarding completely or only allow forwarding
  to the same room for encrypted events.

## Alternatives
### Endpoint behavior
Instead of an endpoint for sending a forward, the new endpoint could be used to
generate the forward content and leave sending it up to the client with the
normal /send endpoint. However, this is an extra roundtrip for the client and
it is not clear if there are any significant benefits in doing so.

## Unstable prefix
While this MSC is not in a released version of the spec, implementations should
use `net.maunium.msc2730` as a prefix and as a `unstable_features` flag in the
`/versions` endpoint.

* `PUT /_matrix/client/unstable/net.maunium.msc2730/rooms/{roomId}/event/{eventId}/forward/{targetRoomId}/{txnId}` as the endpoint
* `net.maunium.msc2730.forwarded` instead of `m.forwarded` in `content` and `unsigned`
* `NET.MAUNIUM.MSC2730_NOT_FORWARDABLE` instead of `M_NOT_FORWARDABLE` as the error code
