# Proposal to support user-owned identifiers as 3rd party identifiers (3PID)

Email and phone numbers are well-established third party identifiers (3PID). The verification that a user owns such an identifiers is usually done by sending an email or SMS. The finalization of the verification requires interaction from the user. With the advances in blockchain technologies, so-called user-owned or "distributed identifiers" (DID) have been established that are created, owned and controlled by the person herself. Third-parties can verify the ownership of DIDs by verifying cryptographic signatures. 

For the matrix protocol, this means 

* that DIDs can be associated and verified with a user account without user-interaction, and 
* that autentication can be done with the username, 3PID and a signature only, without using the user's password similar to [email based authentication via identity server](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#email-based-identity-server). 

Both aspects should be defined in separate MSCs and are mentioned as motivation why DIDs are a good candidate for a new 3PID type.

While DIDs are not human-friendly identifiers by definition there are some DID methods that associate a human-friendly id to DIDs. These ids/names can be used to lookup matrix users through the identity servers as well (in addition to using DIDs for lookup). The details for such a lookup by DID names should be defined in a new MSC.

## Proposal

During the last year decentralized identifiers have been standardized by the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io) (CCG). There exists several methods to create DIDs. A list of these methods is maintained by the [CCG Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry). The group also defines standards to describe properties of identifiers, in particular how to verify ownership of DIDs.

Supporting DIDs as a new 3PID type opens the matrix network to users that are using DIDs, enables applications with control over DIDs to communicate across the borders of DID methods, e.g. connect users with a blockstack.org account (did:stacks:..) to users with sovrin.org accounts (did:sov:..) and to users that do not have any DID but a matrix account. 

DIDs should be defined as a new 3PID type. The medium should be defined as ``m.did``. The address should contains the DID in normalized form as [defined by the W3C CCG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#normalization).

Example:

```
{ 
    medium: "m.did",
    address: "did:stack:v0:15gxXgJyT5tM5A4Cbx99nwccynHYsBouzr-0"
}
```

## Tradeoffs

Instead of adding a new type of 3PID, DID could be defined as a new identifier type (e.g. 
``m.id.did``) as the user has created the DID herself, is in control of it and can be used for authentication. However, DIDs in general and DID methods in particular define their own namespaces that matches the concept of 3PID very well. Users make use of their DIDs in other context, e.g. decentralized apps and might have an interested to make use of them in the context of matrix as well as other users (or apps) know already the user's DID.

Furthermore, a new 3PID could be defined for each DID methods like ``m.did.stacks`` or ``m.did.btcr``. However, it is not clear which methods will be defined in the future and the DID method can also be derived from the address if needed. Therefore, it is not necessary to distinguish mediums for all different methods.

## Potential issues

DIDs are not human-friendly identifiers. Therefore, matrix clients need to provide a good UX to make DIDs usable.

## Security considerations

Associating DIDs with email or phone number could have unwanted privacy implications for the user. However, the user is free to choose which DID she wants to publish or whether to publish one at all.

## Conclusion

Adding support for decentralized identifiers is inline with the vision of matrix.org to build an open, decentralized communication network. The proposed new 3PID type helps users to include their DID as they are used to in other decentralized apps and as they are used to with email and phone numbers. With their cryptographic properties DIDs have the potential to provide a new, password-less, decentralized authentication flow.
