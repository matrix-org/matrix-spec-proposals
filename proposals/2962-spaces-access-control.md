# MSC2962: Managing power levels via Spaces

MSC1772 defines Spaces: a new way to define groups of users and rooms in
Matrix by describing them as a room.  Originally MSC1772 attempted to define
how you could apply permissions to Matrix rooms based on the membership of a
space. However, this is effectively a separate concern from how you model spaces
themselves, and so has been split out into a this separate MSC.

This MSC originally included restricting room membership based on space membership.
This has been split into [MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083).

Thus, the goal of this MSC is to set the power levels in a room based on
membership of a space.

### Managing power levels via spaces

One use-case for spaces is to help manage power levels across a group of
rooms. For example: "Jim has just joined the management team at my company. He
should have moderator rights across all of the company rooms."

Since the event-authorisation rules cannot easily be extended to consider
membership in other rooms, we must map any changes in space membership onto
real `m.room.power_levels` events.

#### Extending the power_levels event

We now have a mix of manually- and automatically- maintained power-level
data. To support this, we extend the existing `m.room.power_levels` event to
add an `auto_users` key:

```js
{
    "type": "m.room.power_levels",
    "content": {
        "users": {
            "@roomadmin:example.com": 100
        },
        "auto_users": {
            "@spaceuser1:example.org": 50
        }
    }
}
```

A user's power level is then specified by an entry in *either* `users` or
`auto_users`. Where a user appears in both sections, `users` takes precedence.

The new `auto_users` key is maintained by a bot user, as described below.

`auto_users` is subject to all of the same authorization checks as the existing
`users` key (see https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v1#authorization-rules,
paragraphs 10a, 10d, 10e).

This change necessitates a new room version.

#### Representing the mapping from spaces to power levels

The desired mapping from spaces to power levels is defined in a new state
event type, `m.room.power_level_mappings`, set in the room whose PLs are being
manipulated. The content should contain a `mappings` key which is an
ordered list, for example:

```js
{
    "type": "m.room.power_level_mappings",
    "state_key": "",
    "content": {
        "mappings": [
            {
                "space": "!mods:example.org",
                "via": ["example.org"],
                "power_level": 50
            },
            {
                "space": "!users:example.org",
                "via": ["example.org"],
                "power_level": 1
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This means that a new `m.room.power_levels` event would be generated whenever
the membership of either `!mods` or `!users` changes. If a user is in both
spaces, `!mods` takes priority because that is listed first.

If `mappings` is not a list, the whole event is ignored. Any entries in the list
which do not match the expected format are ignored.

#### Implementing the mapping

When a new room is created, the server implicitly adds a "room admin bot" to
the room, with the maximum power-level of any of the initial users.
(Homeservers should implement this "bot" internally, rather than requiring
separate software to be installed.)

It is proposed that this "admin bot" use the special user ID with empty
localpart `@:example.com`.

This bot is then responsible for monitoring the `power_level_mappings` state,
and peeking into any spaces mentioned in the content. It can then issue new
`m.room.power_levels` events, updating the value of `auto_users`, whenever the
membership of the spaces in question changes.

It is possible that the admin bot is unable to perform the mapping (for
example, the space cannot be peeked; or the membership of the space is so large
that it cannot be expanded into a single `m.room.power_levels` event). It is
proposed that the bot could notify the room of any problems via
`m.room.message` messages of type `m.msgtype`.

Clearly, updating this event type is extremely powerful. It is expected that
access to it is itself restricted via `power_levels`. This could be enforced by
the admin bot so that no `m.room.power_levels` events are generated unless
`power_level_mappings` is appropriately restricted.

Some sort of rate-limiting may be required to handle the case where the mapped
space has a high rate of membership churn.

#### Alternatives

Things that were considered and dismissed:

* Extend the auth rules to include state from other rooms. Although this feels
  cleaner, a robust implementation would be a hugely complicated
  undertaking. In particular, room state resolution is closely linked to event
  authorisation, and is already highly complex and hard to reason about, and
  yet is fundamental to the security of Matrix.

  In short, we believe such a change would require significant research and
  modelling. A solution based on such a foundation could not practically be
  implemented in the near future.

* Rather than defining the mapping in the room, define a template power-levels
  event in a parent space, which will be inherited by all child rooms. For example:

  ```js
  {
      "type": "m.space.child_power_levels",
      "state_key": "",
      "content": {
          // content as per regular power_levels event
      }
  }
  ```

  Problem 1: No automated mapping from space membership to user list, so the
  user list would have to be maintained manually. On the other hand, this
  could be fine in some situations, where we're just using the space to group
  together rooms, rather than as a user list.

  Problem 2: No scope for nuance, where different rooms have slightly
  different PLs.

  Problem 3: what happens to rooms where several spaces claim it as a child?
  They end up fighting?

  Problem 4: Doesn't allow for random room admins to delegate their PLs to a
  space without being admins in that space.

* To implement the mapping, we require any user who is an admin in the
  space (ie, anyone who has permission to change the access rights in the
  space) to also be admins and members of any child rooms.

  Say Bob is an admin in #doglovers and makes a change that should be
  propagated to all children of that space. His server is then responsible
  for generating a power-levels event on his behalf for each room.

  Problem 1: Bob may not want to be a member of all such rooms.

  Problem 2: It will feel odd that Bob's user is seen to be generating PL
  events every time someone comes and goes from the space.

  Problem 3: It doesn't allow users to set up their own rooms to mirror a
  space, without having any particular control in that space (though it is
  questionable if that is actually a useful feature, at least as far as PLs are
  concerned.)

* Another alternative for implementing the mapping: the user that created the
  relationship event (or rather, their homeserver, using the user's ID) is
  responsible for copying access controls into the room.

  Problem 1: What do you do if the admin who sets up the PL relationship
  disappears? The humans have to step in and create a new admin?

  Problem 2: Again it seems odd that these PL changes come from a single user.

* Is it possible to implement the mappings from multiple users, some of which
  may not have PL 100? After all it's possible to set rooms up so that you can
  change PL events without having PL 100.

  It gets horribly messy very quickly, where some admin users can make some
  changes. So some get supressed and then get made later anyway by a different
  admin user?

* Is it possble to apply finer-grained control to the
  `m.room.power_level_mappings` event than "you must be max(PL)"? Applying
  restrictions post-hoc (ie, having the admin bot ignore settings which were
  set by underpriviledged users) is an absolute minefield. It might be possible
  to apply restrictions at the point that the event is set, but it sounds
  fiddly and it's not clear there is a real use-case.

* This solution smells a bit funny because of the expansions (causing all the
  redundant mxids everywhere as the groups constantly get expanded every time
  something happens).

  * Could we could put a hash of the space membership in the PL instead of
    expanding the whole list, so that servers have a way to check if they are
    applying the same list as everyone else?

    Feels like it will have bad failure modes: what is a server supposed to do
    when the hash doesn't match?

  * Could version the space memberships, so you can compare with the source of
    the space membership data?

  * PL events just record the delta from the previous one? (So a new server
    would need to get all the PLs ever, butâ€¦ is that a bad thing?)  ... maybe

  These optimisations can all be punted down the road to a later room version.

* Other ways of handling the merge of automatic and manual PL settings:

  * Add hints to the automated mapper so that it can maintain manually-assigned
    PLs. This could either be another field in `power_levels` which plays no
    part in event auth:

    ```js
    {
        "type": "m.room.power_levels",
        "content": {
            "users": {
                "@roomadmin:example.com": 100,
                "@spaceuser1:example.org": 50
            },
            "manual_users": {
                "@roomadmin:example.com": 100
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ... or stored in a separate event. Clients would be responsible for updating
    both copies of the manually-assigned PLs on change.

    Problem: Requiring clients to make two changes feels fragile. What if they
    get it wrong? what if they don't know about the second copy because they
    haven't been designed to work in rooms in spaces?

  * Require that even regular PLs go through the automated mapper, by making
    them an explicit input to that mapper, for example with entries in the
    `m.room.power_level_mappings` event suggested above.

    Problem: Requires clients to distinguish between rooms where there is an
    automated mapper, and those where the client should manipulate the PLs
    directly. (Maybe that's not so bad? The presence of the `mappings` event
    should be enough? But still sucks that there are two ways to do the same
    thing, and clients which don't support spaces will get it wrong.)

## Dependencies

 * [MSC1772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772) for room spaces.

## Security considerations

* The peek server has significant power. For example, a poorly chosen peek
  server could lie about the space membership and add an
  `@evil_user:example.org`.

## Unstable prefix

The following mapping will be used for identifiers in this MSC during
development:

Proposed final identifier       | Purpose | Development identifier
------------------------------- | ------- | ----
`m.room.power_level_mappings` | event type | `org.matrix.msc1772.room.power_level_mappings`
`auto_users` | key in `m.room.power_levels` event | `org.matrix.msc1772.auto_users`
