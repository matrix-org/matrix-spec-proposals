# MSC3978: Deprecate room tagging

The functionality provided by room tagging can also be achieved by spaces, and
room tagging is not used by clients any more.

## Proposal

The ["Room Tagging"
module](https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#room-tagging) is
deprecated.  It will be removed in a future version of the spec.  New clients
should not implement support for it.

## Potential issues
