# Room Types

## Problem

The Matrix protocol currently has no mechanism to differentiate rooms
from each other based on their intended use case. There have been
proposals such as
[MSC1769](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1769) and
[MSC1772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772) that use
rooms for purposes other than the traditional messaging
use-case. Without a mechanism to differentiate them from messaging
rooms, clients will display them as they do any other room unless they
work around this limitation on a case-by-case basis.

## Solution

The proposal is to add a new state event, `m.room.type`, to define the
intended usage of the room.

This by itself could be used by a client to properly display rooms
based on their intended usage. However, to optimize the use of
bandwidth for an account used for varying purposes, the filter API
could then be extended to allow for filtering the rooms that are
returned from a sync based on room type. (A client meant for receiving
IoT device data, for example, has no need to receive messages destined
for that account, nor to be aware at all that messaging rooms exist.)

N.B. There's an opportunity here to additionally scope access tokens
to specific room types, but that feels like it's beyond the scope of
this proposal at this point.

## Examples

### m.room.type

```json
{
    "content": {
        "type": "m.messaging"
    },
    "event_id": "$143273582443PhrSn:example.com",
    "origin_server_ts": 1432735824653,
    "room_id": "!jEsUZKDJdhlrceRyVU:example.com",
    "sender": "@user:example.com",
    "state_key": "",
    "type": "m.room.type",
    "unsigned": {
        "age": 1234
    }
}
```

### Filter API Changes

```
POST /_matrix/client/r0/user/%40alice%3Aexample.com/filter HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "room": {
    "state": {
      "types": [
        "m.room.*"
      ],
      "not_rooms": [
        "!726s6s6q:example.com"
      ],
      "room_types": [
        "m.room_type.messaging"
      ],
      "not_room_types": [
        "m.room_type.iot.*"
      ],
    },
  "event_format": "client",
  "event_fields": [
    "type",
    "content",
    "sender"
  ]
}
```
