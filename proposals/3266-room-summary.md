# MSC3266: Room Summary API

Quite a few clients and tools have a need to preview a room:

- matrix.to may want to show avatar and name of a room.
- Nextcloud may want to list the names and avatars of your `/joined_rooms` when
  asking where to share the media.
- A client may want to preview a room, when hovering a room alias, id or after
  clicking on it.
- A client may want to preview a room, when the user is trying to knock on it or
  to show pending knocks.
- A traveller bot may use that to show a room summary on demand without actually
  keeping the whole room state around and having to subscribe to /sync (or
  using the appservice API).
- A client can use this to knock on a room instead of joining it when the user
    tries to join my room alias or link.
- External services can use this API to preview rooms like shields.io.

There are a few ways to request a room summary, but they only support some of
the use cases. The [spaces hierarchy API](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidhierarchy) only provides
limited control over what rooms to summarize and returns a lot more data than
necessary.  `{roomid}/initialSync` and `{roomid}/state/{event_type}` don't work
over federation and are much heavier than necessary or need a lot of http calls
for each room.

## Proposal

A new client-server API, which allows you to fetch a summary of a room by id or
alias.

### Client-Server API

The API returns a summary of the given room, provided the user is either already
a member, or has the necessary permissions to join. (For example, the user may
be a member of a room mentioned in an `allow` condition in the join rules of a
restricted room.)

For unauthenticated requests a response should only be returned if the room is
publicly accessible; specifically, that means either:
 * the room has `join_rule: public` or `join_rule: knock`, or:
 * the room has `history_visibility: world_readable`.

Note that rooms the user has been invited to or knocked at might result in
outdated or partial information, or even a 404 `M_NOT_FOUND` response, since
the the homeserver may not have access to the current state of the room. (In
particular: the federation API does not provide a mechanism to get the current
state of a non-publically-joinable room where the requesting server has no
joined members. Improving this is left for a future MSC.)

A request could look like this:

```
GET /_matrix/client/v1/room_summary/{roomIdOrAlias}?
    via=matrix.org&
    via=neko.dev
```

(This is not under `/rooms`, because it can be used with an alias.)

- `roomIdOrAlias` can be the roomid or an alias to a room.
- `via` are servers that should be tried to request a summary from, if it can't
  be generated locally. These can be from a matrix URI, matrix.to link or a
  `m.space.child` event for example.

A successful `200` response should contain a JSON object giving information about the room. For example:

```json5
{
  room_id: "!ol19s:bleecker.street",
  avatar_url: "mxc://bleecker.street/CHEDDARandBRIE",
  guest_can_join: false,
  name: "CHEESE",
  num_joined_members: 37,
  topic: "Tasty tasty cheese",
  world_readable: true,
  join_rule: "public",
  room_type: "m.space",
  membership: "invite",
  encryption: "m.megolm.v100",
  room_version: "9001",
}
```

See below for a more detailed description of the response.

#### Unauthenticated and guest access

This API may optionally be exposed to unauthenticated users, or guest users, at the choice of
server implementations and administrators. Clients MUST NOT rely on being able
to use the endpoint without authentication, and should degrade gracefully if
access is denied.

 * Rationale: unauthenticated access is beneficial for third-party services such as
   https://matrix.to. On the other hand, allowing unauthenticated access may leak
   information about rooms that would otherwise be restricted to registered users (particularly
   on servers which do not allow public federation), and may lead to unexpected
   resource usage.

Servers may rate limit how often they fetch information over federation more heavily, if the
user is unauthenticated.

When the endpoint is called unauthenticated, the `membership` field will be
absent in the response.

As mentioned above, a successful response should only be returned for
unauthenticated requests where the room is publicly accessible.

#### Response format

If the room cannot be found, the server should return a `404`
HTTP status code along with an `M_NOT_FOUND` error code. The server should
NOT return `M_UNAUTHORIZED` or otherwise divulge existence of a room, that
requires authentication to preview, if the request is unauthenticated or
authenticated by a user without access to the room.

If the request is successful, the server returns a JSON object containing the
following properties:

| property name      | description                                                                                                                                           |

| num_joined_members | Required. Member count of the room                                                                                                                    |
| room_id            | Required. Id of the room                                                                                                                              |
| room_type          | Optional. Type of the room, if any, i.e. `m.space`                                                                                                    |
| topic              | Optional. Topic of the room                                                                                                                           |
| world_readable     | Required. If the room history can be read without joining.                                                                                            |
| allowed_room_ids   | Optional. If the room is a restricted room, these are the room IDs which are specified by the join rules. Empty or omitted otherwise.                 |
| encryption         | Optional. If the room is encrypted, this specifies the algorithm used for this room. Otherwise, omitted.                                              |
| membership         | Optional (1). The current membership of this user in the room. Usually `leave` if the server has no local users (so fetches the room over federation). |
| room_version       | Optional (for historical reasons (2)). Version of the room.                                                                                           |

(1) The `membership` field will not be present when called unauthenticated, but
is required when called authenticated.

(2) Prior to this MSC, `/_matrix/federation/v1/hierarchy/{roomId}` doesn't
return the room version, so `room_version` may be unavailable for remote
rooms.

Most of the fields above are the same as those returned by
[`/_matrix/client/v3/publicRooms`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3publicrooms). (Those
same fields are also a subset of those returned by
[`/_matrix/client/v1/rooms/{roomId}/hierarchy`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidhierarchy).) The
exceptions are:

 * `allowed_room_ids`. This is currently accessible via the federation
   hierarchy endpoint [`GET
   /_matrix/federation/v1/hierarchy/{roomId}`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/server-server-api/#get_matrixfederationv1hierarchyroomid),
   and is necessary
   to distinguish if the room can be joined or only knocked at.

 * `encryption`. Currently part of the [stripped
   state](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#stripped-state). Some
   users may only want to join encrypted rooms; alternatively, clients may want to filter
   out encrypted rooms, for example if they don't support encryption, or do not
   support particular encryption algorithms.

 * `membership`. Exposed solely for convenience: a client has many other ways
   to access this information.

 * `room_version`. Also part of the [stripped
   state](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#stripped-state).
   Can be used by clients to show incompatibilities with a room early.

#### Modifications to `/_matrix/client/v1/rooms/{roomId}/hierarchy`

For symmetry the `room_version`, `allowed_room_ids` and `encryption` fields are
also added to the `/hierarchy` API.

### Server-Server API

For fetching room summaries of a room a server is not joined to, the federation API of the
[`/hierarchy`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/server-server-api/#get_matrixfederationv1hierarchyroomid)
endpoint is reused. This provides (with a few changes) all the information
needed in this MSC, but it also provides a few additional fields and one level
of children of this room.

Additionally the `encryption` and `room_version` fields are added to the
responses for each room.

In theory one could also add the `max_depth` parameter with allowed values of 0
and 1, so that child rooms are excluded, but this performance optimization does
not seem necessary at this time and could be added at any later point while
degrading gracefully.

(Originally there was a separate federation API for this, but it was decided by
the author that lowering the duplication on the federation side is the way to
go.)

## Potential issues

### Performance

Clients may start calling this API very often instead of using the
[`/hierarchy`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidhierarchy)
for spaces or caching the state received via `/sync`.
Looking up all the state events required for this API may cause performance
issues in that case.

To mitigate that, servers are recommended to cache the response for this API and
apply rate limiting if necessary.

## Alternatives

### The Space Summary / `/hierarchy` API

The
[`/hierarchy`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidhierarchy)
API could be used, but it returns more data than necessary by default (but it
can be limited to just 1 room) such as all the `m.space.child` events in a
space, but also is missing the room version, membership and the encryption
field.

Additionally the `/hierarchy` API doesn't work using aliases. This currently
doesn't allow users to preview rooms not known to the local server over
federation. While the user can resolve the alias and then call the `/hierarchy`
API using the resolved roomid, a roomid is not a routable entity, so the server
never receives the information which servers to ask about the requested rooms.
This MSC resolves that by providing a way to pass server names to ask for the
room as well as the alias directly.

For server to server communication the efficiency is not as important, which is
why we use the same API as the `/hierarchy` API to fetch the data over
federation.

### The `sync` API

For joined rooms, the `/sync` API can be used to get a summary for all joined
rooms. Apart from not working for unjoined rooms, like knocks, invites and space
children, `/sync` is very heavy for the server and the client needs to cobble
together information from the `state`, `timeline` and
[`summary`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/688) sections to
calculate the room name, topic and other fields provided in this MSC.

Furthermore, the membership counts in the summary field are only included, if
the client is using lazy loading.  This MSC provides similar information as
calling `/sync`, but to allow it to work for unjoined rooms it only uses information
 from the stripped state. Additionally, it excludes `m.heroes` as well as membership
events, since those are not included in the stripped state of a room. (A client
can call `/joined_members` to receive those if needed. It may still make sense
to include heroes so that clients could construct a human-friendly room display
name in case both the name and the canonical alias are absent; but solving the
security implications with that may better be left to a separate MSC.)

### The `/state` API

The `/state` API could be used, but the response is much bigger than needed,
can't be cached as easily and may need more requests. This also doesn't work
over federation (yet). The variant of this API, which returns the full state of
a room, also does not return stripped events, which prevents it from being used
by non-members. The event for specific events DOES return stripped events, but
could not provide a member count for a room.

### Proper peeking

Peeking could solve this too, but with additional overhead and
[MSC2753](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2753) is much more
complex. You need to add a peek and remember to remove it. For many usecases you
just want to do one request to get info about a room, no history and no updates.
This MSC solves that by reusing the existing hierarchy APIs, returns a
lightweight response and provides a convenient API instead.

### A more batched API

This API could take a list of rooms with included `via`s for each room instead
of a single room (as a POST request). This may have performance benefits for the
federation API and a client could then easily request a summary of all joined
rooms. It could still request the summary of a single room by just including
only a single room in the POST or a convenience GET could be provided by the
server (that looks like this proposal). At the same time, a batched API is inherently
more complex to implement for both clients and servers. Additionally, there are no
known use cases yet that would benefit from batched access.

### MSC3429: Individual room preview API (closed)

[MSC3429](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3429) is an alternative
implementation, but it chooses a different layout. While this layout might make
sense in the future, it is inconsistent with the APIs already in use, harder to
use for clients (iterate array over directly including the interesting fields)
and can't reuse the federation API. In my opinion an MSC in the future, that
bases all summary APIs on a list of stripped events seems like the more
reasonable approach to me and would make the APIs more extensible.

## Security considerations

This API may leak data, if implemented incorrectly or malicious servers could
return wrong results for a summary.

Those are the same concerns as on [MSC2946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946)
or [MSC3173](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3173).

This API could also be used for denial of service type attacks. Appropriate
ratelimiting and caching should be able to mitigate that.

## Unstable prefix

This uses the `im.nheko.summary` unstable prefix. As such the paths are prefixed
with `unstable/im.nheko.summary`.

- the client API will be
    `/_matrix/client/unstable/im.nheko.summary/summary/{roomIdOrAlias}`.

Some implementations still use
    `/_matrix/client/unstable/im.nheko.summary/rooms/{roomIdOrAlias}/summary`,
    but this was a mistake in this MSC. Endpoints using aliases shouldn't be under /rooms.

Additionally the fields `encryption` and `room_version` in the summaries are
prefixed with `im.nheko.summary` as well since it is new. The latter might still
be called `im.nheko.summary.version` in some implementations.
