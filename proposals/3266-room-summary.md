# MSC3266: Room Summary API

Quite a few clients and tools have a need preview a room:

- A client may want to show the room in the roomlist, when showing a space.
- matrix.to may want to show avatar and name of a room.
- Nextcloud may want to list the names and avatars of your `/joined_rooms` when
  asking where to share the media.
- A client may want to preview a room, when hovering a room alias, id or after
  clicking on it.
- A client may want to preview a room, when the user is trying to knock on it or
  to show pending knocks.
- A traveller bot may use that to show a room summary on demand without actually
  keeping the whole room state around and having to subscribe to /sync (or
  using the appservice API).

There are a few ways to request a room summary, but they only support some of
the use cases. The spaces summary API
([MSC2946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946)) only provides
limited control over what rooms to summarize and only works for rooms in spaces.
`{roomid}/initialSync` and `{roomid}/state/{event_type}` don't work over
federation and are much heavier than necessary or need a lot of http calls for
each room.

## Proposal

A new client-server API, which allows you to fetch a summary of a room by id or
alias and a corresponding server-server API, to fetch a summary over federation.

### Client-Server API

The API returns the summary of the specified room, if the room could be found
and the client should be able to view its contents according to the join_rules,
history visibility, space membership and similar rules outlined in
[MSC3173](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3173) as well as if the
user is already a member of that room.

A request could look like this:

```
GET /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomidOrAlias}/summary?
    via=matrix.org&
    via=neko.dev
```

- `roomidOrAlias` can be the roomid or an alias to a room.
- `via` are servers, that should be tried to request a summary from, if it can't
  be generated locally. These can be from a matrix URI, matrix.to link or a
  `m.space.child` event for example.

A response includes the stripped state in the following format:

```json5
{
  room_id: "!ol19s:bleecker.street",
  avatar_url: "mxc://bleecker.street/CHEDDARandBRIE",
  guest_can_join: false,
  name: "CHEESE",
  num_joined_members: 37,
  topic: "Tasty tasty cheese",
  world_readable: true,
  join_rules: "public",
  room_type: "m.space",
  membership: "invite",
  is_encrypted: true,
}
```

These are the same fields as those returned by `/publicRooms`, with a few
additions: `room_type`, `membership` and `is_encrypted`.

All those fields are already accessible as the stripped state according to
[MSC3173](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3173), with the
exception of `membership`. These are the same fields as in
[MSC2946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946) apart from the
adition of the membership field. The membership can already be accessed by a
client anyway, this API just provides it as a convenience.

| room_type          | Optional. Type of the room, if any, i.e. `m.space`                                                                                                    | Used to distinguish rooms from spaces.                                                                                                |
| membership         | The current membership of this user in the room. Usually `leave` if the room is fetched over federation.                                              | Useful to distinguish invites and knocks from joined rooms.                                                                           |
| is_encrypted       | Optional. If the room is encrypted. This is already accessible as stripped state. Currently a bool, but maybe the algorithm makes more sense?         | Some users may only want to join encrypted rooms or clients may want to filter out encrypted rooms, if they don't support encryption. |

It should be possible to call this API without authentication, but servers may
rate limit how often they fetch information over federation more heavily, if the
user is unauthenticated. Also the fields `membership` will be
missing.

### Server-Server API

The Server-Server API mirrors the Client-Server API, with a few exceptions. The
`membership` fields is never present. No `via` field is necessary on the
request, since servers should not forward the request to other servers.
The request also contains an additional field `allowed_room_ids`, which list of
room IDs which give access to this room per
[MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083). This is needed so
that the requesting server knows if the user is allowed to see this room. If
the history is visible without space membership, this field can be ignored by
the requesting server and doesn't need to be present.

The server can't know which user is requesting the summary. As such it should
apply visibility rules to check if any user on the requesting server would have
access to the summary.

A request would be made as follows:

```
GET /_matrix/federation/v1/summary/{roomid}
```

The requesting server should cache the response to this request.

Note that the federation API only allows roomids and should use the usual
protocols to resolve the alias first, since it makes no sense to let anything
but the authoritive server for that alias resolve it.

## Potential issues

### Perfomance

Clients may start calling this API very often instead of using the batched
summary API (MSC2946) for spaces or caching the state received via `/sync`.
Looking up all the state events required for this API may cause performance
issues in that case.

To mitigate that, servers are recommended to cache the response for this API and
apply rate limiting if necessary.

## Alternatives

- The spaces summary API could be used, but it doesn't work for arbitrary rooms
    and you always need to pass the parent space, without any control over the
    rooms being returned.
- For joined rooms, the `/sync` API can be used to get a summary for all joined
    rooms. Apart from not working for unjoined rooms, like knocks, invites and
    space children, `/sync` is very heavy for the server and the client needs to
    cobble together information from the `state`, `timeline` and
    [`summary`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/688) sections to
    calculate the room name, topic and other fields provided in this MSC.
    Furthermore, the membership counts in the summary field are only included, if
    the client is using lazy loading.
    This MSC provides similar information as calling `/sync`, but it uses the
    stripped state, which is needed to allow this to work for unjoined rooms and
    it excludes `m.heroes` as well as membership events, since those are not
    included in the stripped state of a room. (A client can call
    `/joined_members` to receive those if needed. It may still make sense to
    include heroes, but solving the security implications with that may better
    be left to a separate MSC.)
- The `/state` API could be used, but the response is much bigger than needed,
    can't be cached as easily and may need more requests. This also doesn't work
    over federation (yet).
- Peeking could solve this too, but with additional overhead and
    [MSC2753](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2753) is much more
    complex.

## Security considerations

This API may leak data, if implemented incorrectly or malicious servers could
return wrong results for a summary.

Those are the same concerns as on [MSC2946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946)
or [MSC3173](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3173).

This API could also be used for denial of service type attacks. Appropriate
ratelimiting and caching should be able to mitigate that.

## Unstable prefix

This uses the `im.nheko.summary` unstable prefix. As such the paths are prefixed
with `unstable/im.nheko.summary`.

- the client API will be
    `/_matrix/client/unstable/im.nheko.summary/rooms/{roomidOrAlias}/summary`
- the federation API will be
    `/_matrix/federation/unstable/im.nheko.summary/summary/{roomid}`
