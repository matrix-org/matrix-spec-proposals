## MSC2946: Spaces Summary

This MSC depends on [MSC1772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772), which
describes why a Space is useful:

> Collecting rooms together into groups is useful for a number of purposes. Examples include:
>
> * Allowing users to discover different rooms related to a particular topic: for example "official matrix.org rooms".
> * Allowing administrators to manage permissions across a number of rooms: for example "a new employee has joined my company and needs access to all of our rooms".
> * Letting users classify their rooms: for example, separating "work" from "personal" rooms.
>
> We refer to such collections of rooms as "spaces".

This MSC attempts to solve how a member of a space discovers rooms in that space. This
is useful for quickly exposing a user to many aspects of an entire community, using the
examples above, joining the "official matrix.org rooms" space might suggest joining a few
rooms:

* A room to discuss development of the Matrix Spec.
* An announcements room for news related to matrix.org.
* An off-topic room for members of the space.

## Proposal

A new client-server API (and corresponding server-server API) is added which allows
for querying for the rooms and spaces contained within a space. This allows a client
to efficiently display a hierarchy of rooms to a user (i.e. without having
to walk the full state of the space).

### Client-server API

An endpoint is provided to walk the space tree, starting at the provided room ID
("the root room"), and visiting other rooms/spaces found via `m.space.child`
events. It recurses into the children and into their children, etc.

Note that only rooms that have a `type` of `m.space` are considered when searching
for `m.space.child` events.

This endpoint requires authentication and is not subject to rate-limiting.

Example request:

```text
GET /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomID}/spaces?
    max_rooms_per_space=5&
    suggested_only=true
```

Example response:

```jsonc
{
    "rooms": [
        {
            "room_id": "!ol19s:bleecker.street",
            "avatar_url": "mxc://bleecker.street/CHEDDARandBRIE",
            "guest_can_join": false,
            "name": "CHEESE",
            "num_joined_members": 37,
            "topic": "Tasty tasty cheese",
            "world_readable": true,
            "room_type": "m.space",
            "allowed_spaces": ["!abcdef:bleecker.street"]
        },
        { ... }
    ],
    "events": [
        {
            "type": "m.space.child",
            "state_key": "!efgh:example.com",
            "content": {
                "via": ["example.com"],
                "suggested": true
            },
            "room_id": "!ol19s:bleecker.street",
            "sender": "@alice:bleecker.street",
            "creation_ts": 1432735824653
        },
        { ... }
    ]
}
```

Request params:

* **`suggested_only`**: Optional. If `true`, return only child events and rooms where the
  `m.space.child` event has `suggested: true`.  Must be a  boolean, defaults to `false`.
* **`max_rooms_per_space`**: Optional: a client-defined limit to the maximum
  number of children to return per space. Doesn't apply to the root space (ie,
  the `room_id` in the request). Must be a non-negative integer.

  Server implementations should impose a maximum value to avoid resource
  exhaustion.

Response fields:

* **`rooms`**: for each room/space, starting with the root room, a
  summary of that room. The fields are the same as those returned by
  `/publicRooms` (see
  [spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#post-matrix-client-r0-publicrooms)),
  with the addition of:
  * **`room_type`**: the value of the `m.type` field from the room's
    `m.room.create` event, if any.
  * **`allowed_room_ids`**: A list of room IDs which give access to this room per
    [MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083).
* **`events`**: `m.space.child` events of the returned rooms. For each event, only the
  following fields are returned: `type`, `state_key`, `content`, `room_id`,
  `sender`, <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> with the addition of:
  * **`creation_ts`**: the value of the `origin_server_ts` field from the
    `m.space.child` event. This is required for sorting of rooms as specified
    in [MSC1772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772) and updated
    below.

Errors:

403 with an error code of `M_FORBIDDEN`: if the user doesn't have permission to
view/peek the root room (including if that room does not exist). This matches the
behavior of other room endpoints (e.g.
[`/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomID}/aliases`](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-aliases)).
To not divulge whether the user doesn't have permission vs whether the room
does not exist.

#### Algorithm

A rough algorithm follows:

1. Start at the "root" room (the provided room ID).
2. Generate a summary and add it to `rooms`.
3. Add any `m.space.child` events in the room to `events`.
4. Recurse into the targets of the `m.space.child` events.
   1. If the user is not joined to the room and is not joinable (as defined by
      [MSC3173](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3173))
      or has already been processed, do not process it.
   2. Generate a summary for the room and add it to `rooms`.
   3. Add any `m.space.child` events of the room to `events`.
5. Recurse into any newly added targets of `m.space.child` events (i.e. repeat
   step 4), until either all discovered rooms have been inspected, or the
   server-side limit on the number of rooms is reached.

   In the case of the homeserver not having access to the state of a room, the
   server-server API (see below) can be used to query for this information over
   federation from one of the servers provided in the `via` key of the
   `m.space.child` event.

Other notes:

* Any inaccessible children are omitted from the result, as well as the
  `m.space.child` events that point to them.
* There could be loops in the returned child events - clients (and servers)
  should handle this gracefully.
* Similarly, note that a child room might appear multiple times (e.g. also be a
  grandchild). Clients and servers should handle this appropriately.
* `suggested_only` applies transitively.

  For example, if a space A has child space B which is *not* suggested, and space
  B has suggested child room C, and the client makes a summary request for A with
  `suggested_only=true`, neither B **nor** C will be returned.

  Similarly, if a space A has child space B which is suggested, and space B has
  suggested child room C which is suggested, and the client makes a summary request
  for A with `suggested_only=true`, both B and C will be returned.
* `m.space.child` with an invalid `via` (invalid is defined as missing, not an
  array or an empty array) are ignored.

### Server-server API

The Server-Server API has almost the same interface as the Client-Server API.
It is used when a homeserver does not have the state of a room to include in the
summary.

Example request:

```jsonc
GET /_matrix/federation/v1/spaces/{roomID}?
    exclude_rooms=%21a%3Ab&
    exclude_rooms=%21b%3Ac&
    max_rooms_per_space=5&
    suggested_only=true&
```

The response has the same shape as the Client-Server API.

Request parameters are the same as the Client-Server API, with the addition of:

* **`exclude_rooms`**: Optional. A list of room IDs that can be omitted
  from the response.

This is largely the same as the Client-Server API, but differences are:

* The calling server can specify a list of spaces/rooms to omit from the
  response (via `exclude_rooms`).
* `max_rooms_per_space` applies to the root room as well as any returned
  children.
* If the target server is not a member of any discovered children (so
  would have to send another request over federation to inspect them), no
  attempt is made to recurse into them - they" are simply omitted from the
  `rooms` key of the response. (Although they will still appear in the `events`
  key).
  * If the target server is not a member of the root room, an empty
    response is returned.
* The spaces/rooms must be joinable by the server for them to appear in the
  results.

Since the server-server API does not know the user who is requesting a summary of
the space, the response should divulge the above information if any member of a
requesting server could see it. The requesting server is trusted to properly
filter this information.

If a room delegates access to a space (via [MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083))
and there are any users on the requesting server in the correct space, the requesting
server has a right to know about the rooms in that space and should return the
relevant summaries, along with enough information that the requesting server can
then do the necessary filtering.

Consider that Alice and Bob share a server; Alice is a member of a space, but Bob
is not. The remote server will not know whether the request is on behalf of Alice
or Bob (and hence whether it should share details of restricted rooms within that
space).

Consider the above with a restricted room on a different server which defers
access to the above space. When summarizing the space, the homeserver must make
a request over federation for information on the room. The response would include
the room (since Alice is able to join it), but the calling server does not know
*why* they received the room, without additional information the server cannot
properly filter the returned results.

Note that there are still potential situations where each server individually
doesn't have enough information to properly return the full summary, but these
do not seem reasonable in what is considered a normal structure of spaces. (E.g.
in the above example, if the remote server is not in the space and does not know
whether the server is in the space or not it cannot return the room.)

(The alternative, where the calling server sends the requesting `user_id`, and
the target server does the filtering, is unattractive because it rules out a
future world where the calling server can cache the result.)

This does not decrease security since a server could lie and make a request on
behalf of a user in the proper space to see the given information. I.e. the
calling server must be trusted anyway.

## Potential issues

To reduce complexity, only a limited number of rooms are returned for a room,
no effort is made to paginate the results. Proper pagination is left to a future
MSC.

### MSC1772 Ordering

[MSC1772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772) defines the ordering
of "default ordering of siblings in the room list" using the `order` key:

> Rooms are sorted based on a lexicographic ordering of the Unicode codepoints
> of the characters in `order` values. Rooms with no `order` come last, in
> ascending numeric order of the `origin_server_ts` of their `m.room.create`
> events, or ascending lexicographic order of their `room_id`s in case of equal
> `origin_server_ts`. `order`s which are not strings, or do not consist solely
> of ascii characters in the range `\x20` (space) to `\x7F` (~), or consist of
> more than 50 characters, are forbidden and the field should be ignored if
> received.

Unfortunately there are situations when a homeserver comes across a reference to
a child room that is unknown to it and must decide the ordering. Without being
able to see the `m.room.create` event (which it might not have permission to see)
no proper ordering can be given.

Consider the following case of a space with 3 child rooms:

```
         Space A
           |
  +--------+--------+
  |        |        |
Room B   Room C   Room D
```

Space A, Room B, and Room C are on HS1, while Room D is on HS2. HS1 has no users
in Room D (and thus has no state from it). Room B, C, and D do not have an
`order` field set (and default to using the ordering rules above).

When a user asks HS1 for the space summary with a `max_rooms_per_space` equal to
`2` it cannot fulfill this request since it is unsure how to order Room B, Room
C, and Room D, but it can only return 2 of them. It *can* reach out over
federation to HS2 and request a space summary for Room D, but this is undesirable:

* HS1 might not have the permissions to know any  of the state of Room D, so might
  receive a 403 error.
* If we expand the example above to many rooms than this becomes expensive to
  query a remote server simply for ordering.

This proposes changing the ordering rules from MSC1772 to the following:

> Rooms are sorted based on a lexicographic ordering of the Unicode codepoints
> of the characters in `order` values. Rooms with no `order` come last, in
> ascending numeric order of the `origin_server_ts` of their `m.space.child`
> events, or ascending lexicographic order of their `room_id`s in case of equal
> `origin_server_ts`. `order`s which are not strings, or do not consist solely
> of ascii characters in the range `\x20` (space) to `\x7E` (~), or consist of
> more than 50 characters, are forbidden and the field should be ignored if
> received.

This modifies the clauses for calculating the `origin_server_ts` of the
`m.room.create` event to refer to the `m.space.child` event instead. This allows
for a defined sorting of siblings based purely on the information available in
the `m.space.child` event while still allowing for a natural ordering due to the
age of the relationship.

## Alternatives

An initial version of this followed both `m.space.child` and `m.space.parent` events,
but this is unnecessary to provide the expected user experience.

## Security considerations

A space with many rooms on different homeservers could cause multiple federation
requests to be made. A carefully crafted room with inadequate limits on the maximum
rooms per space (or a maximum total number of rooms) could be used in a denial
of service attack.

## Unstable prefix

During development of this feature it will be available at unstable endpoints.

The client-server API will be:
`/_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc2946/rooms/{roomID}/spaces`

The server-server API will be:
`/_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc2946/spaces/{roomID}`

## Footnotes

<a id="f1"/>[1]: The rationale for including stripped events here is to reduce
potential dataleaks (e.g. timestamps, `prev_content`, etc.) and to ensure that
clients do not treat any of this data as authoritative (e.g. if it came back
over federation). The data should not be persisted as actual events.[↩](#a1)
