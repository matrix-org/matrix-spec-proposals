# MSC0000: `m.takedown` moderation policy recommendation

Currently there is one specified moderation policy recommendation, `m.ban`[^spec-ban-recommendation].

> When this recommendation is used, the entities affected by the rule
> should be banned from participation where possible. The enforcement
> of this is deliberately left as an implementation detail to avoid
> the protocol imposing its opinion on how the policy list is to be
> interpreted. However, a suggestion for a simple implementation is as

[^spec-ban-recommendation]: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#mban-recommendation

In practice this recommendation is used by the moderation bots to
store banned rooms, users and servers alongside a reason for the ban.

This has provided the ability to create versatile policy lists that
can ban matrix users for any recorded reason. Not only for spam,
illegal content, csam, but softer reasons such as moderation disputes,
timeouts, inrventions, disagreements.

Unfortunately, because the `m.ban` recommendation has such a broad
use, and its implementation has the same outcome for any consequence,
it is the expectation that a `reason` is provided for each `m.ban`.

This reason inadvertently allows the subject of the moderation policy
to be classified among catagories of abuse, which can be
undesirable. For example, a user called `@yarrgh:example.com` could be
banned for the reason `piracy`. Which would identify
`@yarrgh:example.com` as a pirate. This is problematic because
it would allow other pirates to identify `@yarrgh:example.com` and
join forces. In other situations, it may cause harm or legal
ramifications if `@yarrgh:example.com`'s reputation has been damaged
and they are not a pirate at all.

Additionally, if `@yarrgh:example.com` is known to been smuggling
contraband via matrix events or media, then there is no mechanism
to mark this content as plunder that should be ceased.

A compunding issue is Moderation bots currently use the `reason` of
the ban to determine whether to redact a user's events or not. Which
doesn't allow for a free-form use of the `reason` where redaction is
required.

## Proposal

We introduce a new policy recommendation, `m.takedown`, reserved for
purging entities and any associated content.  When `m.takedown` is
used, a `reason` SHOULD NOT be embedded into the same policy event[^bluesky].

We provide guidance for how the `m.takedown` recommendation is
expected to be consumed by typical moderation tooling or clients.
This is to set expectations for policy list curators for how the
recommendation should behave and the severity of the consequences.  We
also provide guidance to allow tool implementers to understand the
context of the recommendations use. Moderation tools or clients are
free to interpret the recommendation differently, for example if they
are aware of a conflciting policy or they are configured to implement
harsher or more liberal consequences for the recommendation.

If the entity of the rule is a user:

+ Applied to a user: The user and all associated messages, media,
  invitations are hidden and removed from local storage or caches.
  If the user enforcing the recommendation is a moderator in the
  room in common with the target, then messages may be shown
  with a warning behind spoiler text.

+ Applied to a room: The user is banned from the room and all of their
  recent messages redacted.

+ Applied to a server: The user is not allowed to send invites to
  users on the server. Any associated media is quarantined or removed,
  if the user is resident then the user is considered for
  deactivation or suspension.

If the entity of the rule is a room:

+ Applied to a user: The user is parted from the room,
  and be unable to rejoin it. Any invitations to the room are
  hidden and ignored. Any media associated with the room are
  purged from local storage or caches.

+ Applied to a room: No-op because a room can't take itself down.

+ Applied to a server: The room is purged from the server and
  resident users are prevented from joining. Invitations
  to the room are blocked.

If the entity of the rule is a server:

+ Applied to a user: Invitations originating from from users on the
  server are hidden.  Media uploaded from users resident to the target
  server are removed from local storage or caches and never
  displayed.  Messages originating from the server could be hidden
  entirely or behind spoiler text.

+ Applied to a room: The server is added as a denied server in the ACLs.
  All room members resident to the target server are banned from the room
  and have their recent messages redacted.

+ Applied to a server: The enforcing server should avoid federating
  with the target server as much as possible by blocking invites from
  the target server and not sending traffic unless strictly required
  (no outbound invites).  Any media associated with the server is
  quarantined or removed.

## Potential issues

+ It is anticipaited that some consequences of recommending
  `m.takedown` against an entity are irreversible, and can have a huge
  impact on the history of a Matrix room if implemented naively.  The
  most common use case for the recommendation will be to replace the
  use of `m.ban` with the reason `spam` targeting a user, which in
  Mjolinr causes the target user to be banned from protected rooms and

+ Because the `reason` is no longer present, a higher degree of trust
  is required when applying some consequences to these policies.

+ The lack of classification from the `reason` field is insufficient
  to prevent direct identification of some entities. For example
  `@yarrgh:example.com` is evidently a pirate because of the presence
  of the phrase `yarrgh` embeded within their mxid.

## Alternatives

+ `m.ban` Could continue to be used with a more specific reason, but
  this presents problems for automated and semi-automated responses
  because the reasons are not standardised.

+ `m.ban` A `takedown` reason could be given on `m.ban` policies.
  This is pretty adhoc.


## Security considerations

+ `m.takedown` can have severe consequences for entities, policies
  could be created maliciously against innocent users on popular
  policy rooms. This could increasce the reward of infiltrating
  moderation focussed communities. Tools that naively implement
  the recommendation without safeguards, such as manual approval,
  for the most severe consequences could be exploited.
  Additionally, moderation tools ask for confirmation when the
  associated entity is known to be an active participant of the
  community being protected.

## Unstable prefix

*If a proposal is implemented before it is included in the spec, then implementers must ensure that the
implementation is compatible with the final version that lands in the spec. This generally means that
experimental implementations should use `/unstable` endpoints, and use vendor prefixes where necessary.
For more information, see [MSC2324](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2324). This section
should be used to document things such as what endpoints and names are being used while the feature is
in development, the name of the unstable feature flag to use to detect support for the feature, or what
migration steps are needed to switch to newer versions of the proposal.*

## Dependencies

This MSC builds on MSCxxxx, MSCyyyy and MSCzzzz (which at the time of writing have not yet been accepted
into the spec).
