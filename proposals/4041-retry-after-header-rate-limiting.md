# MSC4041: Use http header Retry-After to enable library-assisted retry handling

The current Matrix Client-Server API (v1.7) recommends that home servers should protect themselves from
being overloaded by enforcing rate-limits to selected API calls.
If home servers limit access to an API they respond with an http error code 429 and a response body
that includes a property `retry_after_ms` to indicate how long a client has to wait before retrying.

Some http libraries (like [Ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky), [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got
and [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/urllib3.util.html#urllib3.util.Retry)) ease
the burden of handling retries by honoring the http header `Retry-After`. As explained in 
[RFC 9119 - HTTP Semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#field.retry-after) this header is optional
and contains either a (relative) value for the delay in seconds or an (absolute) date.

The current Matrix Client Server API specification does not take this header into account. This wastes the 
potential that current http libraries offer in terms of automated retry handling.

## Proposal

In order to allow developers to make use of the automated retry handling capabilities of http libraries
home servers shall use the http header `Retry-After` in case they respond with an http error 429.
The value of `Retry-After` (in __seconds__) is meant to be a delay after receiving the response and must be 
calculated in order to comply with the specification in [RFC 9119 - HTTP Semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#field.retry-after).

With the introduction of the http header `Retry-After` the usage of the existing `retry_after_ms` property in the response body becomes deprecated.

## Potential issues

In order to maintain backward compatibility with existing client libraries home servers shall use both the `Retry-After` header and the
`retry_after_ms` property in the response body.

Client libraries shall use the values in this order:

1) `Retry-After` http header.
2) `retry_after_ms` property in the response body.
