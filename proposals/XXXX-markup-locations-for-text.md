# Markup locations for Text

[MSC3574](https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/main/proposals/3574-resource-markup.md)
proposes a mechanism for marking up resources (webpages, documents, videos, and
other files) using Matrix. The proposed mechanism requires an
`m.markup.location` schema for representing the location of annotations within
different kinds of resources. MSC3574 punts on what standard location types
might be available, deferring that large family of questions to other MSCs.
This MSC aims to provide basic location types for marking up textual resources.
