# \[WIP]MSC3262: aPAKE authentication

Like most password authentication, matrix's 
[login](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#post-matrix-client-r0-login) 
requires sending the password in plain text (though usually encrypted in transit with https). 
This requirement has as (obvious) downside that a man in the middle attack would allow reading the password,
but also requires that the server has temporary access to the plaintext password 
(which will subsequently be hashed before storage).

A Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) can prevent the need for sending the password in plaintext for login,
and an aPAKE (asymmetric or augmented) allows for safe authentication without the server ever needing
access to the plaintext password. OPAQUE is a modern implementation of an aPAKE that is
[currently an ietf draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-05), 
but as it's still pending and doesn't have many open source implementations using it would 
require implementing it ourselves. As such choosing to use SRP 
([rfc2945](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2945)) makes more sense. 
SRP has as downside that the salt is transmitted to the client before authentication, 
allowing a precomputation attack which would speed up a followup attack after a server compromise.
However, should a server be compromised, 
it is probably simpler to generate an access token and impersonate the target that way.

## Proposal

Add support for the SRP 6a login flow, as `"type": "m.login.srp6a"`.

### Registration flow

To allow clients to discover the supported groups (and whether srp6a is supported)
the client sends a GET request to /_matrix/client/r0/register

`GET /_matrix/client/r0/register`

```
{
	"auth_types": ["password", "srp6a"]
	"srp_groups": [supported groups]
}
```  
Here the server sends it's supported authentication types (in this case only password and srp6a)
and if applicable it sends the supported SRP groups, as specified by the 
[SRP specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5054#page-16) or 
[rfc3526](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3526).

The client then chooses an srp group and generates a random salt `s`.
The client then calculates the verifier `v` as:

	x = H(s, p)  
	v = g^x

Here H() is a secure hash function, and p is the user specified password.  
Note that all values are calculated modulo N.

This is then sent to the server, otherwise mimicking the password registration, through:

`POST /_matrix/client/r0/register?kind=user`

```
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "example.type.foo",
    "session": "xxxxx",
    "example_credential": "verypoorsharedsecret"
  },
  "auth_type": "srp6a",
  "username": "cheeky_monkey",
  "verifier": v,
  "group": [g,N],
  "salt": s,
  "device_id": "GHTYAJCE",
  "initial_device_display_name": "Jungle Phone",
  "inhibit_login": false
}
```

The server stores the verifier, salt, and group next to the username.  

### Convert from password to SRP

Mimicking the flow of register above, first a GET request is sent to check if SRP is 
supported and find the supported groups, here we'll reuse the register endpoint 
`GET /_matrix/client/r0/register`. *Or we could add a GET endpoint for /_matrix/client/r0/account/password*

To convert to SRP we'll use the [change password endpoint](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#post-matrix-client-r0-account-password) with the 
`"auth_type": "srp6a"` added, and the required `verifier`, `group`, and `salt`.

`POST /_matrix/client/r0/account/password HTTP/1.1`

```
{
  "auth_type": "srp6a",
  "verifier": v,
  "group": [g,N],
  "salt": s,
  "logout_devices": false,
  "auth": {
    "type": "example.type.foo",
    "session": "xxxxx",
    "example_credential": "verypoorsharedsecret"
  }
}
```

The server then removes the old password (or old verifier, group, and salt) and stores the new values.

### Login flow

To start the login flow the client sends it's username to obtain the salt and SRP group as:

`POST /_matrix/client/r0/login`

```
{
  "type": "m.login.srp6a.init",
  "username": "cheeky_monkey"
}
```
The server responds with the salt and SRP group (looked up from the database), and public value `B`:

```
{
  "prime": N,
  "generator": g,
  "salt": s,
  "server_value": B,
  "auth_id": "12345"
}
```
Here N is the prime and g is the generator of the SRP group. s is the stored salt for the user
as supplied in the `POST`, B is the public server value, and auth_id is the id of this authentication flow,
can by any unique random string, used for the server to keep track of the authentication flow.

the server calculates B as:

	B = kv + g^b 

where b is a private randomly generated value for this session (server side) and k is given as:

	k = H(N, g) 

The client then calculates:

	A = g^a 
where a is a private randomly generated value for this session (client side).

Both then calculate:

	u = H(A, B) 

Next the client calculates:

	x = H(s, p)  
	S = (B - kg^x) ^ (a + ux)  
	K = H(S)

The server calculates:

	S = (Av^u) ^ b  
	K = H(S)

Resulting in the shared session key K.

To complete the authentication we need to prove to the server that the session key K is the same.
*note that this proof is directly lifted from the [SRP spec](http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html),
another proof can be possible as well.*

The client calculates:

	M1 = H(H(N) xor H(g), H(I), s, A, B, K)

The client will then respond with:

`POST /_matrix/client/r0/login`

```
{
  "type": "m.login.srp6a.verify",
  "evidence_message": M1,
  "client_value": A,
  "auth_id": "12345"
}
```
Here `M1` is the client evidence message, and A is the public client value.
Upon successful authentication (ie M1 matches) the server will respond with the regular login success status code 200:

To prove the identity of the server to the client we can send back M2 as:

	M2 = H(A, M, K)

```
{
  "user_id": "@cheeky_monkey:matrix.org",
  "access_token": "abc123",
  "device_id": "GHTYAJCE",
  "evidence_message": M2
  "well_known": {
    "m.homeserver": {
      "base_url": "https://example.org"
    },
    "m.identity_server": {
      "base_url": "https://id.example.org"
    }
  }
}
```

The client verifies that M2 matches, and is subsequently logged in.


## Potential issues

Adding this authentication method requires client developers to implement this in all matrix clients.

SRP is vulnerable to precomputation attacks and it is incompatible elliptic-curve cryptography.
Matthew Green judges it as 
["It’s not ideal, but it’s real." and "not obviously broken"](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/)
and it's a fairly old protocol.

## Alternatives

OPAQUE is the more modern protocol, which has the added benefit of not sending the salt in plain text to the client,
but rather uses an 'Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function' and can use elliptic curves.

*Bitwardens scheme can be mentioned here as well, since it does allow auth without the server
learning the plaintext password, but it isn't a PAKE, but rather something along the lines of a hash
of the password before sending the hash to the server for auth, practically making the hash
the new password, and as such it doesn't protect against a mitm.*


## Security considerations

*Probably loads, though SRP and OPAQUE have had lots of eyes, I would assume.*

This whole scheme only works if the user can trust the client, which may be an issue
in the case of a 'random' javascript hosted matrix client, though this is out of scope for this MSC.
