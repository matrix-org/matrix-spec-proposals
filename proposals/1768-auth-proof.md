# Proposal to authenticate with public keys

With the advances in blockchain technologies, so-called user-owned or "distributed identifiers" (DID) have been established that are created, owned and controlled by the person herself. These identifiers come with a cryptographic private/public key pair that can be used to authenticate the user without using the user's password. The user might have control over other private/public key pairs (like local TLS certificates) that can be used in the same way as keys from DIDs. Therefore, this proposal is about a general authentication flow using any private/public key pairs.

In order to authenticate with a matrix home server, the user should proof that she is in control of a public key that was associated with the user's account as administrative contact. A new endpoint should be added that provides a reference to these private/public key pairs.

A second new endpoint should be added that provides a challenge to the user. The user should sign and return the challenge in the authentication request.

## Proposal

User should be able to login with the private/public keys that they control.
The following authentication flow should be defined assuming that the user has already associated her public key with her matrix account using ``/account/3pid/``

A new class of login types should be defined starting with ``m.login.proof.`` followed by the identifier for the relevant cryptographic methods. These identifiers are publishd in the registry of the [W3C Credentials Communicy Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io) for [linked data cryptographic suites](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry). Examples are ``EdDasSASignatureSecp256k1`` or ``RsaSignature2018``.

To use this authentication type in login calls, clients should submit the following:

````
  {
    "type": "m.login.proof.<crypto_suite_id>",
    "challenge": "<challenge>",
    "proof": "<proof>"
  }
````

where the ``proof`` contains the user identifier and a signature containing a challenge that the user has received before from the challenge endpoint of the home server. The (json) type of ``proof`` is defined in [the specification for Linked Data Proofs](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-proofs) and contains ``type`` (of proof; equals to crypto_suite_id), ``creator`` (reference to the user's public key), ``created`` (when the proof/signature was created), ``domain`` (the matrix user name), ``nonce`` (received from the endpoint), ``proofValue`` (the signature).

Example:
````
  {
    "type": "m.login.proof.RSASignature2018",
    "challenge": "achallengefromtheserver",
    "proof": {
        "type": "RSASignature2018",
        "creator": "https://matrix.org/account/friedger/keys/1",
        "created": "2019-01-02T23:21:12Z",
        "domain": "@friedger:matrix.org",
        "nonce": "anoncefromtheuser",
        "proofValue":"eyJ.....fFWFOEjxk"
    },
  }
````

The home server responds with the access token as usual if the proof could be verified using the algorithm specified in the Linked Data Proof document.

If the signature could not be verified the error ``M_UNAUTHORIZED`` should be returned.

The reference endpoint for public keys should be defined as ``/account/<username>/keys/<number>``. It returns a json containing a description of the public key of ``username`` with id ``number`` in the format

````
  {
    "owner": "@friedger:matrix.org",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C....PV",
  }
````

The challenge endpoint should be defined as ``/account/proof/requestChallenge`` and return a random text that is unique for each call (within a time window that is sufficient to complete the login flow).

## Tradeoffs

Instead of adding a new login type, the type ``m.login.password`` could be used. The password could contain the signature of the challenge and during password verification the home server could verify the signature. However, it is not the password of matrix user and therefore, the password login type should not be used.

The verification of the signature and the creation of the challenge for the login call could be handled by the identity server. The user would then just submit the 3PID verificaion credentials of the identity server session for login calls similar to ``m.login.email.identity``. However, this would transfer the responsibility of authentication to the identity server.

Instead of providing a cryptographic proof/signature the user could publish the challenge at a storage location that is only accessible by the user if she is in control of the public key. The home server could then verify the challenge by accessing this (user-owned) storage location. This simplifies the verification process for home server a lot but restricts the user to private/public keys that are associated to decentralized identifiers with user-owned storage hubs (see for example blockstack's gaia and DID documents specification).

The new login type is similar to the token login type. However, the verification of the signature requires an understanding of the proof/signature algorithm for both the server and client. In view of the interactive authentication flow, the server can announce the supported login type (supported crypto methods) and the client can choose the login type (crypto method) of the user's public key.

## Potential issues

* There is no way specified to associate a public key as an administrative account. In MSC1762 a 3PID is defined that describes decentralized identifiers (DIDs) which come with a public keys. This can be used for the reference endpoint of public keys.

* This login flow is verbose as it used vocabulary and object types from the W3C CCG.

* The reference endpoint of public keys does not return a URl/linked document to the owner of the public key as suggested by the W3C CCG. Currently, the matrix protocol has no endpoint to reference the user (i.e. the owner). A reference to an identity server could be returned for public keys that are associated with decentralized identifiers (DIDs). The link would be something like 

````
http://localhost:8090/_matrix/identity/api/v1/lookup?medium=did&address=did:stacks:SM34..4A
````
The returned matrix id should be the same as the domain in the proof.

* The user identifier is usually specified in property ``identifier``. Here, it is contained in the proof as property ``domain`` as it is specified by the Linked Data Proof document.

## Security considerations

* The challenge returned from the challenge endpoint should be used only once per user (within a time window that is sufficient for the login to complete) to repevent so-called replay attacks.

* The cryptographic proof methods could be weak and bad actors could gain access to the user's account using vulnerabilities in these methods.

## Conclusion

Adding authentication using public keys is inline with the vision of matrix.org to build an open, decentralized communication network. The proposed authentication types helps users to authenticate without using a password or a trusted third-party.
