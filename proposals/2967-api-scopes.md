# MSC2967: API scopes

This proposal is part of the broader [MSC3861: Next-generation auth for Matrix, based on OAuth 2.0/OIDC][MSC3861].

When a user signs in with a Matrix client, it currently gives the client full access to their Matrix account.

This proposal introduces access scopes to allow restricting client access to only part(s) of the Matrix client API.

## Proposal

[MSC2964] introduces the usage of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant to authenticate against a Matrix homeserver.

A OAuth 2.0 grant has a scope associated to it which provides a framework for obtaining user consent.

The framework encourages the practise of obtaining additional use consent when a client asks for a new scope that was not granted previously.

This MSC does not attempt to define all the scopes necessary to cover all Matrix APIs and use cases, but proposes the structure of a namespace and a few scopes to cover existing use cases.

### Scope format

All scopes related to Matrix should start with `urn:matrix:` and use the `:` delimiter for further sub-division.

Scopes related to mapping of Client-Server API access levels should start with `urn:matrix:client:`.

For future MSCs that build on this namespace, unstable subdivisions should be used whilst in development.

For example, if MSCXXX wants to introduce the `urn:matrix:client:foo` scope, it could use `urn:matrix:client:com.example.mscXXXX.foo` during development.
If it needs to introduce multiple scopes, like `urn:matrix:client:foo` and `urn:matrix:client:bar`, it could use `urn:matrix:client:com.example.mscXXXX:foo` and `urn:matrix:client:com.example.mscXXXX:bar`.

### Allocated scopes

#### Full API read/write access

To support the existing semantic of granting full access to the Matrix C-S API the following scope is assigned:

| Scope | Purpose |
| - | - |
| `urn:matrix:client:api:*` | Grants full access to the Client-Server API |

In the future, a client would request more specific actions when required. e.g. something like `urn:matrix:client:api:read:*`

#### Device ID handling

Presently a device ID is typically generated by the homeserver and is associated with a specific series of access tokens.

This MSC proposes that the Matrix client is responsible for generating/allocating a device ID.
A client can create a new device ID by generating a random string and asking for its associated scope on login.
A client can adopt and rehydrate an existing client by asking for its scope on login.

The client can then bind the device ID to the grant by requesting a scope comprising of a [RFC3986] URN in the format:

| Scope | Purpose | Implementation notes |
| - | - | - |
| `urn:matrix:client:device:<device ID>` | bind the given device ID to the grant/access token | The homeserver must only grant exactly one device scope for a token. |

The device ID scope MUST be present *at most* once in the scope.

When generating a new device ID, the client SHOULD generate a random string with enough entropy.
It SHOULD only use characters from the unreserved character list defined by [RFC3986]:

> unreserved = a-z / A-Z / 0-9 / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"

Using this alphabet, a 10 character string is enough to stand a sufficient chance of being unique.
The homeserver MAY reject a request for a device ID that is not long enough or contains characters outside the unreserved list.

In any case it MUST only use characters allowed by the OAuth 2.0 scope definition in [RFC6749] section 3.3,
which is defined as the following ASCII ranges: `%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E`, i.e:

 - alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`)
 - the following characters: `! # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ ] ^ _ \` { | } ~`

### Future scopes

Exact scopes for the whole API are intentionally not specified in this MSC.

It is envisioned that the namespace could be further partitioned to support use cases such as read only, write only, limited to one or more rooms etc.

Some thoughts/ideas for possible scopes are:

- `urn:matrix:client:api:<permission>` or `urn:matrix:client:api:<permission>:*` - grant limited access to the client API in all rooms. Permissions could be read, write, delete, append.
- `urn:matrix:client:api:read:<resource>` - read-only access to the client API for just the named resource. e.g. `urn:matrix:client:api:read:#matrix-auth`

New MSCs should be created for proposing and discussing such new scopes.

## Potential issues

The Device ID handling involves a change in where device IDs are generated.
Because the device ID is now generated by the client, it is possible to have a device ID collision.

Requiring enough entropy on the device ID ensures that the device ID is unique.
With a 66 character alphabet and a 10 character device ID, the probability of a collision between 100 million devices is around 0.3%:

$$N = 66^{10}$$
$$K = 10^{8}$$
$$P \approx 1 - e^{-\frac{K^2}{2N}}$$
$$P \approx 0.00318$$

This does also restrict the possible alphabet of device IDs, which was not restricted before.

## Alternatives

### Scopes

Scope could also have an URL format, e.g. `https://matrix.org/api/*/read`.

The URL prefix could either be static (`https://matrix.org`) or dependant on the homeserver (`https://matrix.example.com`).
In both cases, the URL could be confused with API endpoints and in the second case it would require discovery to know what scopes to ask.

The actual namespace prefix and subdivisions are open to debate.

## Security considerations

As we are just representing existing access models there shouldn't be anything special.

## Unstable prefix

While this feature is in development the following unstable scope prefixes should be used:

- `urn:matrix:client` --> `urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client`
