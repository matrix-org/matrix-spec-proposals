# MSC3820: Room Version 11

A new room version, `11`, is proposed using [room version 10](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/rooms/v10/) as a base
and incorporating the following MSCs:

* [MSC2174](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2174) - Move `redacts` to sane place
* [MSC2175](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2175) - Remove `creator` field from `m.room.create` events
* [MSC2176](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2176) - Updates to redaction rules
* [MSC3989](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3989) - Redact `origin` on events
* [MSC3821](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3821) - More updates to redaction rules

Though other MSCs are capable of being included in this version, they do not have sufficient implementation to be
considered stable enough for v11 rooms. A future room version may still include them. Such examples of ineligible MSCs
are:

* [MSC2244](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2244) - Mass redactions
* A number of MSCs which have not yet been accepted (they are not iterated here).

Room version 11 upon being added to the specification shall be considered stable. No other room versions are affected
by this MSC.

## Unstable prefix

Implementations looking to test v11 before written into the specification should use `org.matrix.msc3820.opt2`
as the room version, treating it as unstable.

Note: `org.matrix.msc3820.opt1` is from a prior draft of this proposal, consisting of different MSCs than the
current iteration. Implementations should not treat opt1 the same as other unstable-for-MSC3820 versions.
