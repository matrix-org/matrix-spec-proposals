# MSC2448: Using BlurHash as a Placeholder for Matrix Media

[BlurHash](https://blurha.sh) is a compact representation of a placeholder
for an image (or a frame of video). Currently, in Matrix, clients must
display a placeholder image in the message timeline while a piece of media is
loading. Some clients, such as Element, simply display an empty space.

While thumbnails exist to combat this to some degree, they still need to be
downloaded from a homeserver, which is not instantaneous.

Instead, a BlurHash can be sent inside events, which upon
receipt other clients can render for a pretty media preview while the actual
thumbnail downloads. They also do not contain any `"` characters, making them
simple to stick inside existing JSON blobs.

To be clear: A BlurHash does not replace a thumbnail - rather it is a placeholder
and should be shown before the thumbnail is downloaded. For a familiar messaging
user experience, clients are recommended to first render and display a blurhash,
then download the thumbnail of the media. Once the thumbnail file is downloaded,
display it. Finally, the user can optionally view the full media item by selecting it.

## Proposal

### m.room.message

An optional field is added in `m.room.message`'s `content.info` dictionary
with the key `blurhash`. It is a BlurHash of the original piece of media.
Clients could then render this using [one of the available BlurHash
implementations](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash).

This would be optionally displayed while the thumbnail of the media is loaded
in parallel.

Example `m.room.message` content:

```json
{
  "body": "image.png",
  "info": {
    "size": 149234,
    "mimetype": "image/png",
    "thumbnail_info": {
      "w": 301,
      "h": 193,
      "mimetype": "image/png",
      "size": 72958
    },
    "w": 301,
    "h": 193,
    "thumbnail_url": "mxc://example.org/abcdefg",
    "blurhash": "JadR*.7kCMdnj"
  },
  "msgtype": "m.image",
  "url": "mxc://example.org/abcde"
}
```

Note that a BlurHash representation is really only applicable to media, and
as such should only be used in conjunction with the following
`m.room.message` msgtypes:

* `m.image`
* `m.video`

### m.sticker

An optional field is added to `m.sticker`'s `content.info` dictionary with
the key `blurhash`. Its value is a BlurHash of the sticker media.

Example `m.sticker` content:

```json
{
  "body": "Landing",
  "info": {
    "h": 200,
    "mimetype": "image/png",
    "size": 73602,
    "thumbnail_info": {
      "h": 200,
      "mimetype": "image/png",
      "size": 73602,
      "w": 140
    },
    "thumbnail_url": "mxc://matrix.org/sHhqkFCvSkFwtmvtETOtKnLP",
    "w": 140,
    "blurhash": "JadR*.7kCMdnj"
  },
  "url": "mxc://matrix.org/sHhqkFCvSkFwtmvtETOtKnLP"
}
```

### m.room.avatar

Room avatars having BlurHashes available will be especially useful when
viewing a server's Public Rooms directory.

An optional field is added to `m.room.avatar`'s `content.info` dictionary with the
key `blurhash`. Its value is a BlurHash of the media that is pointed to by
`url`.

Example `m.room.avatar` content:

```json
{
  "url": "mxc://matrix.example.com/a59ee02f180677d83d1b57d366127f8e1afdd4ed",
  "info": {
    "blurhash": "JadR*.7kCMdnj"
  }
}
```

### m.room.member

Much like room avatars, user avatars can have BlurHashes as well. There is a
little more required to implement this, but the outcome of no longer having
missing avatars upon opening a room is worthwhile.

An optional field is added to `m.room.member`'s `content` dictionary with
the key `blurhash`. Its value is a BlurHash of the media that is pointed
to by `avatar_url`.

Note that `blurhash` MUST be omitted if `avatar_url` is not present.

Example `m.room.member` event content:

```json
{
  "avatar_url": "mxc://example.org/SEsfnsuifSDFSSEF",
  "displayname": "Alice Margatroid",
  "membership": "join",
  "blurhash": "JadR*.7kCMdnj"
}
```

### Profile endpoints

Endpoints that return profile information, and thus MXC URLs to user avatars, are
extended to optionally include BlurHashes as well.

[`GET /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3profileuserid)
has an optional field added with
the key `blurhash`. Its value is a BlurHash of the media that is pointed to
by `avatar_url`. `blurhash` MUST be omitted if `avatar_url` is not present.
The same applies
to [`GET /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}/avatar_url`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3profileuseridavatar_url)
, and to the federation
endpoint [`GET /_matrix/federation/v1/query/profile`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/server-server-api/#get_matrixfederationv1queryprofile)
.

#### Example responses:

`GET /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}`

```json5
{
  "avatar_url": "mxc://matrix.org/SDGdghriugerRg",
  "displayname": "Alice Margatroid",
  "blurhash": "oyp8ky2BWn7VHEL"
}
```

`GET /_matrix/federation/v1/query/profile`

```json5
{
  "avatar_url": "mxc://matrix.org/SDGdghriugerRg",
  "displayname": "Alice Margatroid",
  "blurhash": "oyp8ky2BWn7VHEL"
}
```

`GET /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}/avatar_url`

```json5
{
  "avatar_url": "mxc://matrix.org/SDGdghriugerRg",
  "blurhash": "oyp8ky2BWn7VHEL"
}
```

Separately, [`PUT /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}/avatar_url`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#put_matrixclientv3profileuseridavatar_url)
has an optional field added
to the request body with the key `blurhash`. Its value is a BlurHash of the media that is pointed to by the value of
the `avatar_url` field in the same request.

#### Example request/response interaction

Request:
```
PUT /_matrix/client/v3/profile/{userId}/avatar_url HTTP/1.1

{
  "avatar_url": "mxc://matrix.org/SDGdghriugerRg",
  "blurhash": "oyp8ky2BWn7VHEL"
}
```

Successful response:

```
200 OK

{}
```

### URL previews

An optional attribute is added to the OpenGraph data returned by a call
to
[`GET /_matrix/media/v3/preview_url`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#get_matrixmediav3preview_url)
called `matrix:image:blurhash`. The value
of this attribute is the blurhash representation of the media specified
by `og:image`. Note that we place this value under the `matrix` namespace as
the [OpenGraph protocol](https://ogp.me/) does not (yet) have a spec'd field
for BlurHashes.

Note that `matrix:image:blurhash` MUST be omitted if `og:image` is not present
in the response.

Example response to `GET /_matrix/media/v3/preview_url`:

```json
{
  "og:title": "Matrix Blog Post",
  "og:description": "This is a really cool blog post from matrix.org",
  "og:image": "mxc://example.com/ascERGshawAWawugaAcauga",
  "og:image:type": "image/png",
  "og:image:height": 48,
  "og:image:width": 48,
  "matrix:image:size": 102400,
  "matrix:image:blurhash": "oyp8ky2BWn7VHEL"
}
```

### Inline images

An optional attribute is added to `<img>` tags in messages:
`data-mx-blurhash`, where the value of the attribute is the blurhash
representation of the inline image.

This would be optionally displayed while the inline image itself is loaded in
parallel.

Example `m.room.message.formatted_body`:

```
"formatted_body": This is awesome <img alt=\"flutterjoy\" title=\"flutterjoy\" height=\"32\" src=\"mxc://matrix.example.org/abc\" data-mx-blurhash=\"LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo\" />
```

## Calculating a blurhash on the server

BlurHashes are inserted into events by the client, however some clients may not
be able to implement the BlurHash library for whatever reason. In this case, it
would be nice to allow the media repository to calculate the BlurHash of a piece
of media for the client, similar to how thumbnails are calculated by media
repositories today.

A new boolean query parameter, `generate_blurhash`, is added to
[`POST /_matrix/media/v3/upload`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#post_matrixmediav3upload)
which allows clients to ask the server to generate a BlurHash for them. This
may be useful for clients that are designed to run on very low-power hardware,
or otherwise cannot generate a BlurHash itself.
If set to `true`, the server SHOULD generate a BlurHash of the uploaded media
and return it as the value of the `blurhash` key in the response.

If the server cannot generate a BlurHash of the media - perhaps because it is
not a file that a BlurHash can be derived from or it is too expensive to process
a very large piece of media - then the server SHOULD NOT return a `blurhash` key
in the response. Additionally, if `generate_blurhash` is not `true`, then the
server SHOULD NOT return a `blurhash` key in the response.

Fundamentally, this means that clients SHOULD NOT assume that a server will always
return a BlurHash in the response to `/_matrix/media/v3/upload`, even if they have
set the `generate_blurhash` query parameter to `true` in the request.

An example request from a client that would like the server to generate a
blurhash would look like:

```
POST /_matrix/media/v3/upload?generate_blurhash=true&filename=My+Family+Photo.jpeg HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: image/jpeg

<bytes>
```

Example response:

```
{
  "content_uri": "mxc://example.com/abcde123",
  "blurhash": "LKO2?U%2Tw=w]~RB"
}
```

We explicitly make this behaviour opt-in as it is assumed that the majority of
clients that end up supporting BlurHashes will be capable of generating them
locally. Thus, the less load we can put on the homeserver (by not making
blurhash generation the default) the better.

Note that media servers will not be able to return a BlurHash string for
encrypted media; that must be left to the client.

The server could additionally return the BlurHash string for an image when
given an MXC URL. This would be through something like the Media Information
API (specified in
[MSC2380](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2380)), or similar.

## Visualisation

Viewing an image message that is loading:

![blurhashed preview](images/2448-blurhash.png)

Once the image loads:

![the image has loaded](images/2448-loaded-image.png)

As a sample, this is Element's behaviour prior to this MSC's introduction:

![boo, sad](images/2448-current-state.png)

## Alternatives

We could include a base64 thumbnail of the image in the event, but blurhash
produces much more efficient textual representations.

## Backwards compatibility

Older clients would ignore the new `blurhash` parameter.

Newer clients would only show it if it exists.

Users who have not specified `blurhash` in their `m.room.member` event yet may
stand out from users who have while both are loading. This is entirely up to
clients to handle, though a suggestion may be to "fake" a blurhash by
blurring some placeholder image (perhaps something with variation between
users like Element's coloured backgrounds with letters in them, or [an
identicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) derived from the user's
ID) until the user's actual avatar loads.

## Unstable prefixes

Implementations wishing to add this before this MSC is merged can do so with
the following:

* The `blurhash` key in any events, request or response bodies should be
  replaced with `xyz.amorgan.blurhash`.

* `/_matrix/media/v3/upload`'s new `generate_blurhash` query parameter
  should instead be `xyz.amorgan.generate_blurhash`. And instead of the
  key `blurhash`, the endpoint should return `xyz.amorgan.blurhash`.

* The `data-mx-blurhash` attribute in `<img>` tags should be replaced with
  `data-xyz-amorgan-blurhash`.

## Security considerations

BlurHash entries in encrypted events, be it as part of the `info` property,
or `<img>` tags, should be encrypted along with the rest of the event
content.

A [discussion in
#matrix-spec](https://matrix.to/#/!NasysSDfxKxZBzJJoE:matrix.org/$Cfa0dtF3DenIUAbC5aeg3Xo10gAF54mAJLZ6VzvYNfo?via=matrix.org&via=amorgan.xyz&via=pixie.town)
questioned whether massive BlurHashes may be a potential DoS vector for
clients. The discussion found that only a maximum of 100 x 100 components can
be defined by a BlurHash. This may be in the higher range for low-resource
(or unoptimised) clients, and clients are free to refuse to render a BlurHash
with a large component count, but it shouldn't be a cause for concern.

Invalid BlurHashes should not be rendered.
