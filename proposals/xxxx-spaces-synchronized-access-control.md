# MSC0000: Synchronized access control for Spaces

A mechanism like Spaces ([MSC1772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772), now merged) is frequently used to group together rooms with different topics, that belong to the same community or organization with a single moderation team and policy. To this end, it should be possible to define both roles ("powerlevels") and permissions ("required powerlevels") once and then have them apply to every room in a Space.

[MSC2962](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2962) is one proposal that aims to address the "roles" side, though not the "permissions" side. Unfortunately, it has a high degree of complexity, does not fit well into the existing protocol semantics, and has a lot of unanswered questions regarding authorative homeservers which could lead to it becoming a de-facto centralized mechanism.

This MSC proposes an alternative solution to the problem which does not suffer from these issues, and which additionally also covers the "permissions" side of the problem. *Unlike* the original MSC2962 (since split out into [MSC3083](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083)), however, it does not address membership restrictions at all - I consider this a separate concern which may not even be specific to Spaces, and therefore it should live in a separate proposal. It would be neither a dependency nor a dependent of this proposal.

## Proposal

Whereas MSC2962 addresses the problem from an angle of a specially-privileged pseudo-user which is externally controlled with its own authorization rules, this proposal instead addresses it as strictly a *replication* problem - if an already-privileged user chooses to apply role or permission changes to a Space as a whole, how can this be replicated to all of its child rooms in a semantically consistent and predictable manner?

This approach has three main advantages:

1. It does not introduce an all-powerful pseudo-user with its own access control mechanisms. This avoids the entire class of [confused deputy problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem), where said pseudo-user could be abused by an attacker to make changes that they would not otherwise be permitted to make, if for any reason its access control mechanism didn't *exactly* match that of the normal powerlevel system.
2. All access control changes are made *directly* by the initiating user. This means that there is no question of which homeserver should be authoratively responsible for updating the powerlevels - the answer is always "the homeserver of the user making the changes". Likewise, it means that it is always clear from the room history who initiated the change, without needing further lookups.
3. It is completely agnostic to the actual powerlevel system used; since the proposal just concerns itself with *replication*, it does not matter *what* gets replicated, and so any future changes to the access control mechanism in the Matrix protocol would likely not require changes to this replication mechanism.

In the rest of this proposal, "roles" will be used to refer what are currently the powerlevel assignments to specific users, and "permissions" will be used to refer to what are currently the *required* powerlevels for executing some sort of action.

The high-level mechanism works as follows: when a user updates either the roles or permissions of a Space, their homeserver will, on their behalf, translate this to a role/permission update for each room that the Space contains. If this is not possible because the user has an insufficient role in some rooms, then the operation will atomically fail unless an "allow partial" flag is set. If the replication fails in *all* rooms, the operation will fail completely, with or without the flag.

UI-wise, this allows for roughly three scenarios:

1. The user has the necessary role in all of the Space's rooms, and the operation succeeds at once. This is the common case for Spaces which are correctly set up to provide multiple topic rooms for a single community or organization.
2. The user has the necessary role in some but not all of the Space's rooms. In this case, the flag-less operation will fail, and the user can be prompted whether they would like to apply the change to those rooms where it is possible anyway. If the user chooses yes, the operation is reattempted, but this time with an "allow partial" flag, and it succeeds. This case will typically occur when a Space is not correctly set up, or in private Spaces for the user's personal bookmarking/categorization purposes.
3. The user does not have the necessary role in any of the Space's rooms. The operation will fail. This is also typical for private Spaces.

The prerequisite for correct setup of a Space, such that this replication mechanism will function as intended, is for at least one user to have a sufficient role in all of the Space's rooms - where "sufficient" means "has the necessary role to apply all of the intended access control changes, including future ones". In practice, the easiest way to satisfy this requirement under typical circumstances is to ensure that they are an Admin (PL 100) in all of the Space's rooms.

From this point on, the "bootstrapping user" can then simply define the rest of the roles and permissions for the Space, which gets replicated to all of its rooms; those with a sufficient role on this replicated list can then, transitively, start to use the Spaces access control replication mechanism themselves, as *their* roles are now also consistent across rooms. In this way, the mechanism keeps itself consistent across rooms over time, so long as no rules are defined directly in a specific room that interfere with it (such as a single-room demote).

Such interfering rules may actually be desirable in some cases; for example, preventing a specific user from obtaining a specific role in a specific room, despite holding it in the rest of the Space. Because of this, replicated roles and permissions are defined separately in `m.room.power_levels` from the explicitly-given ones; this works similarly to MSC2962, where the explicitly-given settings take precedence.

### Technical changes

The `m.room.power_levels` event would be extended with a `space_defaults` property, which may contain all of the same keys (except for `space_defaults` itself) that an `m.room.power_levels` event may contain directly.

Additionally, an `m.space.power_levels` state event would be introduced, which stores the most recent replicated powerlevels directly into the Space. This event does not play a role in the state resolution algorithm, and only serves as a way for clients to learn what the most recent Space-level powerlevels were set to, for UI/display purposes. This way, clients do not need to pull the `space_defaults` from multiple rooms and try to work out which of them actually belong to this specific Space.

The state resolution algorithm would be modified so that instead of the current permission/role lookup algorithms...

```
kick / ban / invite / redact -> 50
events[type] -> state_default / events_default -> 50 / 0
users[mxid] -> users_default -> 0
```

... the algorithms are changed to include a lookup in the `space_defaults`, like so:

```
kick / ban / invite / redact -> space_defaults.kick / space_defaults.ban / space_defaults.invite / space_defaults.redact -> 50
events[type] -> space_defaults.events[type] -> state_default / events_default -> space_defaults.state_default / space_defaults.events_default -> 50 / 0
users[mxid] -> space_defaults.users[mxid] -> users_default -> space_defaults.users_default -> 0
```

Note that a `space_defaults` lookup for specific users and event types is done __before__ using a local event/user default like `state_default`; otherwise, it would not be possible for a Space to specify any specific entries at all whenever a local default is set. Essentially, "check specific before general levels" has precedence over "check local before space levels".

For this to work correctly, it's important that clients and homeserver implementations *do not* automatically set any permissions in a newly-created room, other than those which the user has explicitly asked for - explicitly reproducing the defaults in an `m.room.power_levels` event would result in the fallback to `space_defaults` never occurring.

A new API endpoint would be created at `POST /_matrix/client/r0/spaces/{spaceId}/set_power_levels`, taking a `power_levels` property that defines the new power levels to apply to the Space's rooms (to be inserted in the `space_defaults` property of each room's power levels event), and an `allow_partial_update` property that implements the behaviour described earlier.

XXX: An endpoint prefix of `/rooms` could also be used instead of `/spaces`? This would be consistent with eg. the `join` and `invite` routes, but since this operation is only semantically meaningful on a Space, it should perhaps *not* be consistent in that way.

Subspaces should be accounted for, and treated as a part of the Space, for the purpose of this operation; that is, all rooms in subspaces (to arbitrary depth) should have the powerlevel changes applied to them, likewise causing a failure if this is not possible for some rooms.

The following error responses may occur for this endpoint:

- __200__ - Operation succeeded as requested; either all or some rooms have been updated, depending on the `allow_partial_update` flag.
- __403 M_FORBIDDEN__ - Reserved for Space-level permission issues, eg. if there were to be some kind of required permission in the Space itself for doing a replicated powerlevel change. This proposal does not currently define such a mechanism, but reserves it to avoid confusion with permission issues caused by rooms.
- __403 M_ALL_FORBIDDEN__ - The user does not have the necessary access to change powerlevels in *any* of the rooms in the Space. Retrying with `allow_partial_update` will still fail.
- __403 M_PARTIALLY_FORBIDDEN__ - The user does not have the necessary access to change powerlevels in *some* of the rooms in the Space. Retrying with `allow_partial_update` will likely succeed; though a client should still account for receiving an `M_ALL_FORBIDDEN` in that case, eg. if the user's role in the affected rooms changes in the meantime.

XXX: Should we allow a homeserver to always return M_PARTIALLY_FORBIDDEN even when *none* of the rooms can be updated, eg. for performance reasons? This would make it difficult for clients to present a coherent UX, as a "do you want to apply the change to only some of the rooms" dialog will be shown even in cases where choosing "yes" could never result in success anyway - which would be confusing messaging to users.

If successful, the response body is as follows:

```js
{
  "partialSuccess": true, // Whether only some rooms succeeded (true) or *all* rooms succeeded (false)
  "failedRooms": [ // A list of room IDs of those rooms whose powerlevels could *not* be updated
    "!room1:homeserver.tld",
    "!room2:homeserver.tld",
    "!room4:homeserver.tld"
  ]
}
```

## Potential issues

1. This approach will require a new room version to be specified, which takes into consideration `space_defaults`. The same is true, however, for MSC2962.

2. With this approach, powerlevel changes will be published as an event created by the user who actually initiated them, rather than a bot. While this removes a certain degree of anonymity from moderation operations, that anonymity can be regained by simply outsourcing this job to a bot user if a given community desires to have this property.

3. Determining whether a powerlevel change was "successfully replicated" is dependent on having an accurate view of the *current* permissions and roles of each affected room. There may be circumstances where the initiating user's homeserver is 'behind' on this, and so their homeserver may end up (incorrectly) reporting success, with the change being reverted down the line. This is already currently the case for regular powerlevel changes, and should be quite rare, so I don't feel that this is a significant problem.

4. It is possible for a room to be "desynced" from the Space when one room moderator removes the role of another, making it impossible for them to do a replicated powerlevel change across the Space without using the 'partial' flag. While this doesn't literally *break* anything, it can be confusing for a moderator to be faced with an unexpected warning dialog, and there should probably be some mechanism for debugging such desyncs; eg. a way to see the specific rooms in the Space where the user's role diverges from the other rooms.

5. If a room is added to multiple Spaces, and receives different replicated powerlevel changes through both of them, the room's powerlevels can "oscillate" between those of the two Spaces. This is mainly a UX issue.

## Alternatives

Those listed in [MSC2962](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2962/proposals/2962-spaces-access-control.md#alternatives), as well as MSC2962 itself.

## Security considerations

As stated above, a major consideration for choosing this approach is that it's not prone to confused deputy problems.

It does not introduce any new security mechanisms, other than a small mechanical change in state resolution, the correctness of which can be easily reasoned about.

## Unstable prefix

Unstable implementations should use the following identifiers:

- Space-level state event: `net.cryto.mscXXXX.space.power_levels` instead of `m.space.power_levels`
- Space defaults property: `net.cryto.mscXXXX.space_defaults` instead of `space_defaults`
- API endpoint: `/_matrix/client/unstable/net.cryto.mscXXXX/spaces/{spaceId}/set_power_levels` instead of `/_matrix/client/r0/spaces/{spaceId}/set_power_levels`
- Room version: `net.cryto.mscXXX.1`
