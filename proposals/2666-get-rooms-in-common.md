# MSC 2666: Get rooms in common with another user

It is useful to be able to fetch rooms you have in common with another user. Popular messaging services
such as Telegram offer users the ability to show "groups in common", which allows users to determine
what they have in common before participating in converstion.

There are a variety of applications for this information. Some users may want to block invites from
users they do not share a room with at the client level, and need a way to poll the homeserver for
this information. Another use case would be trying to determine how a user came across your mxid, as
invites on their own do not present much context. With this endpoint, a client could tell you what
rooms you have in common before you accept an invite.

While this information can be determined if the user has full access to member state for all rooms,
modern clients tend to implement "lazy-loaded" design patterns, so they often only have state for the
rooms the user has interacted with, or at least a subset of all rooms they are in. Therefore, the homeserver
should have a means to provide this information.

This proposal aims to implement a simple mechanism to fetch rooms you have in common with another user.

## Proposal

Homeservers should implement a new endpoint `/users/{current_user}/shared_rooms/{other_user_id}` which will take
the authenticated users MxID and the user that is being searched for.

The response format will be an array containing all rooms where both the `current_user` and `other_user_id` have
a membership of type `join`. 

```
GET _matrix/client/unstable/users/@alice:example.com/shared_rooms/@bob:example.com
```

```json
{
    "rooms": [
    "!OGEhHVWSdvArJzumhm:matrix.org",
    "!HYlSnuBHTxUPgyZPKC:half-shot.uk",
    "!DueayyFpVTeVOQiYjR:example.com"
  ]
}
```

## Potential issues

Homeserver performance OR storage may be impacted by this endpoint. While a homeserver already stores
membership information for each of it's users, the information may not be stored in a way that is quickly
accessible. Homeservers that have implemented [POST /user-directory/search](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#post-matrix-client-r0-user-directory-search)
may have started some of this work, if they are limiting users to searching for users for which they
share rooms. While this is not a given by any means, it may mean that implementations of this API
and /search may be complimentary.


## Alternatives

A client can already read all membership for all rooms, and thus determine which of those rooms contains
a "join" membership for the given user_id. However, this method is computationally expensive on the homeserver
and the client. Furthermore, it would increase total network traffic (which is important for low bandwith / mobile clients)
as well as include lots of extranious information.


## Security considerations

The information provided in this endpoint is also accessible to day, if the client is in posession of all
state that the user can see. This endpoint only makes it possible to view this information without having
to request all state ahead of time.


## Unstable prefix

The implementation MUST use `/_matrix/client/unstable/users/{user_id}/shared_rooms/{other_user_id}`.
The /versions endpoint MUST include a new key in `unstable_features` with the name `uk.half-shot.msc2666`.
Once the MSC has been merged, clients should use `/_matrix/client/r0/users/{user_id}/shared_rooms/{other_user_id}`
and will no longer need to check for the `unstable_features` flag.
