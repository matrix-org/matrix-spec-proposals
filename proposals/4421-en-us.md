# MSC4421: Standardize the spec on US English 🇺🇸

The spec's house style currently recommends British over American English[^1]. This has historically
not been strongly enforced, however. For instance, there are multiple instances of both "authorize"
(🇺🇸) and "authorise" (🇬🇧) in the spec text as well as in identifiers such as `M_UNAUTHORIZED` and
`m.unauthorised`. While this inconsistency usually doesn't hinder readability, it negatively impacts
searchability and general consistency of the spec.

Standardizing on British English is difficult though because many other technical standards use the
American spelling. For instance, RFC6749 defines the term "authorization server"[^2] as well as the
`authorization_code` grant type[^3] as an identifier. Using the British spelling when covering these
in the Matrix spec would be confusing for terms and impossible for identifiers.

For comparison, the following noteworthy standards use American English:

- W3C[^4]
- IEEE[^5]
- ANSI[^6]

In contrast, the following standards enforce British English:

- ISO[^7]

Lastly, these standards allow either of the two as long as they are used consistently within a
document:

- RFCs[^8]

Given the dominant use of US English in other standards and the unsolvable problem of localizing
identifiers, this proposal seeks to standardize Matrix on US English.

## Proposal

The spec's house rules are updated to RECOMMEND the American over the British spelling. Existing
spec text and identifiers are not updated but MAY be migrated in future. Any new spec text or
identifiers SHOULD use the American spelling.

## Potential issues

This proposal doesn't directly resolve the current inconsistency of both spellings being used in the
spec simultaneously. It paves the way for an eventually consistent spelling without the need for
busywork, however.

Many of the spec contributors and especially members of the core team have a British background.
Departing from their native spelling might feel odd for some.

Matrix has a huge center of mass in Europe. In a time of transatlantic tension, committing to the
American spelling might feel uncomfortable to some. Language and politics should not be conflated,
however.

## Alternatives

We could enforce the British spelling in spec text and identifiers that are not inherited from other
standards. To aid searchability, a legend of common words that differ in spelling could be included
at the bottom of each page.

    authorise -> authorize
    authorisation -> authorization
    ...

A reader searching for "authorization" would at least land on the legend and receive a cue to search
for "authorisation" instead. This feels more complicated and less practical than standardizing on US
English, however.

## Security considerations

None.

## Unstable prefix

None.

## Dependencies

None.
