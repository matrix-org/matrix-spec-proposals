# MSC2733 : Add hCaptcha as captcha provider

This MSC proposes to generalize the use of a captcha api in the matrix spec and that 
hCaptch is to be added to to provide a more privacy focused alternative to reCaptcha.

## Context

Since google is well known for their misuse of their customers data and general disregard 
for basic privacy rights it is desireable to distance the Matrix spec from such a company.
The ubiquitously used reCaptcha is one such mechanism to accumulate more private data for Google.

## Proposal

The Matrix spec should not directly reference reCaptcha as the only captcha provider. 
The spec should be generalized to use multiple captcha API's. hCaptcha should be added first
as a captcha provider and also should be used as the default moving forward.

This move would have multiple benefits:
* Not relying on Google
* Protecting users privacy, see [here](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy)
* The captchas are easier to solve and aren't confusing like reCaptcha sometimes can be (only from my own and anecdotal experiences)
* Used by Cloudflare, see [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/).
* Supports [Privacy Pass](https://privacypass.github.io/)

**All proposed changes listed chronologically:**
* implement needed changes for multiple captcha providers
* implementing hCaptcha api calls
* switching to hCaptcha as default captcha provider
* dropping reCaptcha

## Potential issues
As a potential issue there would be the variables in homeserver.yaml, namely `recaptcha_public_key` `recaptcha_private_key` `recaptcha_siteverify_api` which would need to be renamed, which breaks config backwards compatibility.
Also adoption and integration with clients like element.io and so on could become an issue and possibly cumbersome to maintain multiple captcha providers.

## Alternatives

Some alternatives have been discussed in multiple Issues [1](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/3606) [2](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1281).
There are generally two views regarding alternatives for reCaptcha. Design oriented and Security/Privacy oriented.
For Design, there are two notable mentions:
* [VisualCaptcha](https://visualcaptcha.net/)
* [MTCaptcha](https://www.mtcaptcha.com/)
Regarding security and privacy the by far best option is [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/)
Since hCaptcha is pretty simmilar to reCaptcha design wise, it would be the ideal replacement since the majority of users are already familiar with reCaptcha.

## Security considerations

Arguably hCaptch isn't as bot proof as reCaptcha is, but to what degree is uncertain.
