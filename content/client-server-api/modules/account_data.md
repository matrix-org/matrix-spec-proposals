### Client Config

Clients can store custom config data for their account on their
homeserver. This account data will be synced between different devices
and can persist across installations on a particular device. Users may
only view the account data for their own account

The account\_data may be either global or scoped to a particular rooms.

#### Events

The client receives the account data as events in the `account_data`
sections of a `/sync`.

These events can also be received in a `/events` response or in the
`account_data` section of a room in `/sync`. `m.tag` events appearing in
`/events` will have a `room_id` with the room the tags are for.

#### Client Behaviour

{{% http-api spec="client-server" api="account-data" %}}

#### Server Behaviour

Servers MUST reject clients from setting account data for event types
that the server manages. Currently, this only includes
[m.fully\_read](#mfully_read).
