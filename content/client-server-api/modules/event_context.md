### Event Context

This API returns a number of events that happened just before and after
the specified event. This allows clients to get the context surrounding
an event.

#### Client behaviour

There is a single HTTP API for retrieving event context, documented
below.

{{% http-api spec="client-server" api="event_context" %}}

#### Security considerations

The server must only return results that the user has permission to see.
