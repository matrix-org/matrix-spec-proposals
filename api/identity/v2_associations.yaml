        Remove an association between a session and a Matrix user ID.

        Future calls to ``/lookup`` for any of the session's 3pids will not
        return the removed association.

        The identity server should authenticate the request in one of two
        ways:

        1. The request is signed by the homeserver which controls the ``user_id``.
        2. The request includes the ``sid`` and ``client_secret`` parameters,
           as per ``/3pid/bind``, which proves ownership of the 3PID.

        If this endpoint returns a JSON Matrix error, that error should be passed
        through to the client requesting an unbind through a homeserver, if the
        homeserver is acting on behalf of a client.
