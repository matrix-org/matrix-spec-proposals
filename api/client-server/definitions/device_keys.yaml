title: DeviceKeys
description: Device identity keys
properties:
  user_id:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The ID of the user the device belongs to. Must match the user ID used
      when logging in.
    example: "@alice:example.com"
  device_id:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The ID of the device these keys belong to. Must match the device ID used
      when logging in.
    example: "JLAFKJWSCS"
  algorithms:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |-
      The encryption algorithms supported by this device.
    example: ["m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2", "m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2"]
  keys:
    type: object
    description: |-
       Public identity keys. The names of the properties should be in the
       format ``<algorithm>:<device_id>``. The keys themselves should be
       encoded as specified by the key algorithm.
    additionalProperties:
       type: string
    example:
      "curve25519:JLAFKJWSCS": "3C5BFWi2Y8MaVvjM8M22DBmh24PmgR0nPvJOIArzgyI"
      "ed25519:JLAFKJWSCS": "lEuiRJBit0IG6nUf5pUzWTUEsRVVe/HJkoKuEww9ULI"
  signatures:
    type: object
    description: |-
       Signatures for the device key object. A map from user ID, to a map from
       ``<algorithm>:<device_id>`` to the signature.

       The signature is calculated using the process described at `Signing
       JSON`_.
