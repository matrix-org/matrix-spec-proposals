    id_server:
      type: string
      description: |-
        The hostname of the identity server to communicate with. May optionally
        include a port. This parameter is ignored when the homeserver handles
        3PID verification.

        This parameter is deprected with a plan to be removed in a future specification
        version for ``/account/password`` and ``/register`` requests.
      example: "id.example.com"
    id_access_token:
      type: string
      description: |-
        An access token previously registered with the identity server. Servers
        can treat this as optional to distinguish between r0.5-compatible clients
        and this specification version.

        Required if an ``id_server`` is supplied.
