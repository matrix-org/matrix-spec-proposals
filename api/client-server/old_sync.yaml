        This will listen for new events and return them to the caller. This will
        block until an event is received, or until the ``timeout`` is reached.

        This endpoint was deprecated in r0 of this specification. Clients
        should instead call the |/sync|_ API with a ``since`` parameter. See
        the `migration guide
