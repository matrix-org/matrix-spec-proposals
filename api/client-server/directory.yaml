        The server will use the federation API to resolve the alias if the

        domain.

        Remove a mapping of room alias to room ID.

        Servers may choose to implement additional access control checks here, for instance that
        room aliases can only be deleted by their creator or a server administrator.

        .. Note::
           Servers may choose to update the ``alt_aliases`` for the ``m.room.canonical_alias``
           state event in the room when an alias is removed. Servers which choose to update the
           canonical alias event are recommended to, in addition to their other relevant permission
           checks, delete the alias and return a successful response even if the user does not
           have permission to update the ``m.room.canonical_alias`` event.

        Get a list of aliases maintained by the local server for the
        given room.

        This endpoint can be called by users who are in the room (external
        users receive an ``M_FORBIDDEN`` error response). If the room's
        ``m.room.history_visibility`` maps to ``world_readable``, any
        user can call this endpoint.

        Servers may choose to implement additional access control checks here,
        such as allowing server administrators to view aliases regardless of
        membership.

        .. Note::
           Clients are recommended not to display this list of aliases prominently
           as they are not curated, unlike those listed in the ``m.room.canonical_alias``
           state event.
