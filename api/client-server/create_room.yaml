      summary: Create a new room
      description: |-
        Create a new room with various configuration options.

        The server MUST apply the normal state resolution rules when creating
        the new room, including checking power levels for each event. It MUST
        apply the events implied by the request in the following order:

        0. A default ``m.room.power_levels`` event, giving the room creator
           (and not other members) permission to send state events. Overridden
           by the ``power_level_content_override`` parameter.

        1. Events set by the ``preset``. Currently these are the ``m.room.join_rules``,
           ``m.room.history_visibility``, and ``m.room.guest_access`` state events.

        2. Events listed in ``initial_state``, in the order that they are
           listed.

        3. Events implied by ``name`` and ``topic`` (``m.room.name`` and ``m.room.topic``
           state events).

        4. Invite events implied by ``invite`` and ``invite_3pid`` (``m.room.member`` with
           ``membership: invite`` and ``m.room.third_party_invite``).

        The available presets do the following with respect to room state:

        ========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
                 Preset           ``join_rules``  ``history_visibility``  ``guest_access``  Other
        ========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========
        ``private_chat``          ``invite``      ``shared``              ``can_join``
        ``trusted_private_chat``  ``invite``      ``shared``              ``can_join``      All invitees are given the same power level as the room creator.
        ``public_chat``           ``public``      ``shared``              ``forbidden``
        ========================  ==============  ======================  ================  =========

        The server will create a ``m.room.create`` event in the room with the
        requesting user as the creator, alongside other keys provided in the
        ``creation_content``.

                description: |-
                  A ``public`` visibility indicates that the room will be shown
                  in the published room list. A ``private`` visibility will hide
                  the room from the published room list. Rooms default to
                  ``private`` visibility if this key is not included. NB: This
                  should not be confused with ``join_rules`` which also uses the
                  word ``public``.
              room_alias_name:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The desired room alias **local part**. If this is included, a
                  room alias will be created and mapped to the newly created
                  room. The alias will belong on the *same* homeserver which
                  created the room. For example, if this was set to "foo" and
                  sent to the homeserver "example.com" the complete room alias
                  would be ``#foo:example.com``.

                  The complete room alias will become the canonical alias for
                  the room.

                  If this is included, an ``m.room.name`` event will be sent
                  into the room to indicate the name of the room. See Room
                  Events for more information on ``m.room.name``.

                  If this is included, an ``m.room.topic`` event will be sent
                  into the room to indicate the topic for the room. See Room
                  Events for more information on ``m.room.topic``.

                description: |-
                  A list of user IDs to invite to the room. This will tell the
                  server to invite everyone in the list to the newly created room.

                  The room version to set for the room. If not provided, the homeserver is
                  to use its configured default. If provided, the homeserver will return a
                  400 error with the errcode ``M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION`` if it does not
                  support the room version.

                  Extra keys, such as ``m.federate``, to be added to the content
                  of the `m.room.create`_ event. The server will clobber the following
                  keys: ``creator``, ``room_version``. Future versions of the specification
                  may allow the server to clobber other keys.
              initial_state:
                type: array
                description: |-
                  A list of state events to set in the new room. This allows
                  the user to override the default state events set in the new
                  room. The expected format of the state events are an object
                  with type, state_key and content keys set.

                  Takes precedence over events set by ``preset``, but gets
                  overriden by ``name`` and ``topic`` keys.

                description: |-
                  Convenience parameter for setting various default state events
                  based on a preset.

                  If unspecified, the server should use the ``visibility`` to determine
                  which preset to use. A visbility of ``public`` equates to a preset of
                  ``public_chat`` and ``private`` visibility equates to a preset of
                  ``private_chat``.
              is_direct:
                type: boolean
                description: |-
                  This flag makes the server set the ``is_direct`` flag on the
                  ``m.room.member`` events sent to the users in ``invite`` and
                  ``invite_3pid``. See `Direct Messaging`_ for more information.

                title: Power Level Event Content
                type: object

                  The power level content to override in the default power level
                  event. This object is applied on top of the generated `m.room.power_levels`_
                  event content prior to it being sent to the room. Defaults to
                  overriding nothing.

            The request is invalid. A meaningful ``errcode`` and description
            error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection include:

            - The request body is malformed (``errcode`` set to ``M_BAD_JSON``
              or ``M_NOT_JSON``).

            - The room alias specified is already taken (``errcode`` set to
              ``M_ROOM_IN_USE``).

            - The initial state implied by the parameters to the request is
              invalid: for example, the user's ``power_level`` is set below
              that necessary to set the room name (``errcode`` set to
              ``M_INVALID_ROOM_STATE``).

            - The homeserver doesn't support the requested room version, or
              one or more users being invited to the new room are residents
              of a homeserver which does not support the requested room version.
              The ``errcode`` will be ``M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION`` in these
              cases.
