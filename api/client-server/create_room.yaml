                description: |-
                  A ``public`` visibility indicates that the room will be shown
                  in the published room list. A ``private`` visibility will hide
                  the room from the published room list. Rooms default to
                  ``private`` visibility if this key is not included. NB: This
                  should not be confused with ``join_rules`` which also uses the
                  word ``public``.
              room_alias_name:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The desired room alias **local part**. If this is included, a
                  room alias will be created and mapped to the newly created
                  room. The alias will belong on the *same* homeserver which
                  created the room. For example, if this was set to "foo" and
                  sent to the homeserver "example.com" the complete room alias
                  would be ``#foo:example.com``.

                  If this is included, an ``m.room.name`` event will be sent
                  into the room to indicate the name of the room. See Room
                  Events for more information on ``m.room.name``.

                type: string
                description: |-
                  If this is included, an ``m.room.topic`` event will be sent
                  into the room to indicate the topic for the room. See Room
                  Events for more information on ``m.room.topic``.

                  A list of user IDs to invite to the room. This will tell the
                  server to invite everyone in the list to the newly created room.

              initial_state:

                  A list of state events to set in the new room. This allows
                  the user to override the default state events set in the new
                  room. The expected format of the state events are an object
                  with type, state_key and content keys set.
                  Takes precedence over events set by ``presets``, but gets
                  overriden by ``name`` and ``topic`` keys.
