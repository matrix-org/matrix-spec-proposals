                  An access token for the account.
                  This access token can then be used to authorize other requests.
                  The access token may expire at some point, and if so, it SHOULD come with a ``refresh_token``.
                  There is no specific error message to indicate that a request has failed because
                  an access token has expired; instead, if a client has reason to believe its
                  access token is valid, and it receives an auth error, they should attempt to
                  refresh for a new token on failure, and retry the request with the new token.

                type: string
                # TODO: Work out how to linkify /tokenrefresh
                description: |-
                  (optional) A ``refresh_token`` may be exchanged for a new ``access_token`` using the /tokenrefresh API endpoint.
