      summary: Authenticates the user.
      description: |-
        Authenticates the user, and issues an access token they can
        use to authorize themself in subsequent requests.

        If the client does not supply a ``device_id``, the server must
        auto-generate one.

        The returned access token must be associated with the ``device_id``
        supplied by the client or generated by the server. The server may
        invalidate any access token previously associated with that device. See
        `Relationship between access tokens and devices`_.
