      summary: Register for an account on this homeserver.
      description: |-
        This API endpoint uses the `User-Interactive Authentication API`_, except in
        the cases where a guest account is being registered.

        Register for an account on this homeserver.

        There are two kinds of user account:

        - `user` accounts. These accounts may use the full API described in this specification.

        - `guest` accounts. These accounts may have limited permissions and may not be supported by all servers.

        If registration is successful, this endpoint will issue an access token
        the client can use to authorize itself in subsequent requests.

        If the client does not supply a ``device_id``, the server must
        auto-generate one.

        The server SHOULD register an account with a User ID based on the
        ``username`` provided, if any. Note that the grammar of Matrix User ID
        localparts is restricted, so the server MUST either map the provided
        ``username`` onto a ``user_id`` in a logical manner, or reject
        ``username``\s which do not comply to the grammar, with
        ``M_INVALID_USERNAME``.

        Matrix clients MUST NOT assume that localpart of the registered
        ``user_id`` matches the provided ``username``.

        The returned access token must be associated with the ``device_id``
        supplied by the client or generated by the server. The server may
        invalidate any access token previously associated with that device. See
        `Relationship between access tokens and devices`_.

        When registering a guest account, all parameters in the request body
        with the exception of ``initial_device_display_name`` MUST BE ignored
        by the server. The server MUST pick a ``device_id`` for the account
        regardless of input.

        Any user ID returned by this API must conform to the grammar given in the
        `Matrix specification <../appendices.html#user-identifiers>`_.

                  ``user_id`` (by splitting at the first colon) if they require
                  it. Note also that ``homeserver`` is not spelt this way.

            Part of the request was invalid. This may include one of the following error codes:

            * ``M_USER_IN_USE`` : The desired user ID is already taken.
            * ``M_INVALID_USERNAME`` : The desired user ID is not a valid user name.
            * ``M_EXCLUSIVE`` : The desired user ID is in the exclusive namespace
              claimed by an application service.

            These errors may be returned at any stage of the registration process,
            including after authentication if the requested user ID was registered
            whilst the client was performing authentication.

            Homeservers MUST perform the relevant checks and return these codes before
            performing User-Interactive Authentication, although they may also return
            them after authentication is completed if, for example, the requested user ID
            was registered whilst the client was performing authentication.

        valid access token is provided. The homeserver SHOULD NOT revoke the
        access token provided in the request, however all other access tokens
        for the user should be revoked if the request succeeds.

        This API endpoint uses the `User-Interactive Authentication API`_.

        An access token should be submitted to this endpoint if the client has
        an active session.

        The homeserver may change the flows available depending on whether a
        valid access token is provided.

        Unlike other endpoints, this endpoint does not take an ``id_access_token``
        parameter because the homeserver is expected to sign the request to the
        identity server instead.

                  ``no-support`` indicates that one or more identifiers failed to unbind

        Checks to see if a username is available, and valid, for the server.

        The server should check to ensure that, at the time of the request, the
        username requested is available for use. This includes verifying that an
        application service has not claimed the username and that the username
        fits the server's desired requirements (for example, a server could dictate
        that it does not permit usernames with underscores).

        Matrix clients may wish to use this API prior to attempting registration,
        however the clients must also be aware that using this API does not normally
        reserve the username. This can mean that the username becomes unavailable
        between checking its availability and attempting to register it.
