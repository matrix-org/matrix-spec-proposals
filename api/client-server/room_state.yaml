        .. _`put-matrix-client-%CLIENT_MAJOR_VERSION%-rooms-roomid-state-eventtype`:

        State events can be sent using this endpoint.  These events will be
        overwritten if ``<room id>``, ``<event type>`` and ``<state key>`` all
        match.

        Requests to this endpoint **cannot use transaction IDs**
        like other ``PUT`` paths because they cannot be differentiated from the
        ``state_key``. Furthermore, ``POST`` is unsupported on state paths.

        The body of the request should be the content object of the event; the
        fields in this object will vary depending on the type of event. See
        `Room Events`_ for the ``m.`` event specification.
