      summary: Gets Matrix server discovery information about the domain.
      description: |-
        Gets discovery information about the domain. The file may include
        additional keys, which MUST follow the Java package naming convention,
        e.g. ``com.example.myapp.property``. This ensures property names are
        suitably namespaced for each application and reduces the risk of
        clashes.

        Note that this endpoint is not necessarily handled by the homeserver,
        but by another webserver, to be used for discovering the homeserver URL.
