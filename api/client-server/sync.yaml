      summary: Synchronise the client's state and receive new messages.
      description: |-
        Synchronise the client's state with the latest state on the server.
        Clients use this API when they first log in to get an initial snapshot
        of the state on the server, and then continue to call this API to get
        incremental deltas to the state, and to receive new messages.

      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: filter
          type: string
          description: |-
            The ID of a filter created using the filter API or a filter JSON
            object encoded as a string. The server will detect whether it is
            an ID or a JSON object by whether the first character is a ``"{"``
            open brace. Passing the JSON inline is best suited to one off
            requests. Creating a filter using the filter API is recommended for
            clients that reuse the same filter multiple times, for example in
            long poll requests.
          x-example: "66696p746572"
        - in: query
          name: since
          type: string

            Controls whether to include the full state for all rooms the user
            is a member of.

            If this is set to ``true``, then all state events will be returned,
            even if ``since`` is non-empty. The timeline will still be limited
            by the ``since`` parameter. In this case, the ``timeout`` parameter
            will be ignored and the query will return immediately, possibly with
            an empty timeline.

            If ``false``, and ``since`` is non-empty, only state which has
            changed since the point indicated by ``since`` will be returned.

            By default, this is ``false``.
          x-example: "false"
        - in: query
          name: set_presence
          type: string

          description: |-
            Controls whether the client is automatically marked as online by
            polling this API. If this parameter is omitted then the client is
            automatically marked as online when it uses this API. Otherwise if
            the parameter is set to "offline" then the client is not marked as
            being online when it uses this API.
          x-example: "offline"
