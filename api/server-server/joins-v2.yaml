      summary: Submit a signed join event to a resident server
      description: |-
        .. Note::
           This API is nearly identical to the v1 API with the
           exception of the response format being fixed.

        This endpoint is preferred over the v1 API as it provides
        a more standarised response format. Senders which receive
        a 400, 404, or other status code which indicates this endpoint
        is not available should retry using the v1 API instead.

        Submits a signed join event to the resident server for it
        to accept it into the room's graph. Note that events have
        a different format depending on the room version - check
        the `room version specification`_ for precise event formats.
        **The request and response body here describe the common
        event fields in more detail and may be missing other required
        fields for a PDU.**
