    description: Room identifier.
    example: "!abc123:matrix.org"
  sender:
    type: string
    description: The ID of the user sending the event.
    example: "@someone:matrix.org"
  origin:
    type: string
    description: The ``server_name`` of the homeserver that created this event.
    example: "matrix.org"

    type: string
    description: Event type
    example: "m.room.message"
  state_key:
    type: string
    description: |-
      If this key is present, the event is a state event, and it will replace previous events
      with the same ``type`` and ``state_key`` in the room state.
    example: "my_key"
  content:
    type: object
    description: The content of the event.
    example: {"key": "value"}
  prev_events:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Event IDs and reference hashes for the most recent events in the room
      that the homeserver was aware of when it made this event.
    items:
      type: array
      maxItems: 2

          required: ['sha256']
  depth:
    type: integer
    description: |-
      The maximum depth of the ``prev_events``, plus one. Must be less than the
      maximum value for an integer (2^63 - 1). If the room's depth is already at
      the limit, the depth must be set to the limit.
    example: 12

      Event IDs and reference hashes for the authorization events that would
      allow this event to be in the room.

  unsigned:
    type: object
    title: Example Unsigned Data
    description: |-
      Additional data added by the origin server but not covered by the ``signatures``. More
