title: m.device_list_update
description: |-
  An EDU that lets servers push details to each other when one of their users
  adds a new device to their account, required for E2E encryption to correctly
  target the current set of devices for a given user.

# FIXME: It's very unclear why we have this API surface for synchronising
# device lists, rather than just using a room (which could also be used for
# profile info, etc).  But documenting what we have for now...

              An ID sent by the server for this update, unique for a given
              user_id.  Used to identify any gaps in the sequence of ``m.device_list_update``
              EDUs broadcast by a server.

          prev_id:

            description: |-
              The stream_ids of any prior m.device_list_update EDUs sent for this user
              which have not been referred to already in an EDU's prev_id field.  If the
              receiving server does not recognise any of the prev_ids, it means an EDU
              has been lost and the server should query a snapshot of the device list
              via ``/user/keys/query`` in order to correctly interpret future ``m.device_list_update``
              EDUs.  May be missing or empty for the first EDU in a sequence.
