      summary: Invites a remote user to a room
      description: |-
        Invites a remote user to a room. Once the event has been  signed by both the inviting
        homeserver and the invited homeserver, it can be sent to all of the servers in the
        room by the inviting homeserver.

        Servers should prefer to use the v2 API for invites instead of the v1 API. Servers
        which receive a v1 invite request must assume that the room version is either ``"1"``
        or ``"2"``.

        Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check the
        `room version specification`_ for precise event formats. **The request and response
        bodies here describe the common event fields in more detail and may be missing other
        required fields for a PDU.**

            The invite is not allowed. This could be for a number of reasons, including:

            * The sender is not allowed to send invites to the target user/homeserver.
            * The homeserver does not permit anyone to invite its users.
            * The homeserver refuses to participate in the room.
