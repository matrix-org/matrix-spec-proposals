description: 'The ``m.notice`` type is primarily intended for responses from automated clients. An ``m.notice`` message must be treated the same way as a regular ``m.text`` message with two exceptions. Firstly, clients should present ``m.notice`` messages to users in a distinct manner, and secondly, ``m.notice`` messages must never be automatically responded to. This helps to prevent infinite-loop situations where two automated clients continuously exchange messages.'
