# Note: this, and the example, are in the `event-schemas` directory because
# the CS API uses a symlink. In order for the `m.room.member` event to
# reference this, we'd need to use relative pathing. The symlink makes this
# difficult because the schema would be at two different locations, with
# different relative pathing.
