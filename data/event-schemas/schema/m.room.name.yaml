    A room has an opaque room ID which is not human-friendly to read. A room
    alias is human-friendly, but not all rooms have room aliases. The room name
    is a human-friendly string designed to be displayed to the end-user. The
    room name is not unique, as multiple rooms can have the same room name set.

    A room with an `m.room.name` event with an absent, null, or empty
    `name` field should be treated the same as a room with no `m.room.name`
    event.

    An event of this type is automatically created when creating a room using
    `/createRoom` with the `name` key.
