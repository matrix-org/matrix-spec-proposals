description: In addition to the Room Event fields, State Events have the following
  additional fields.
properties:
  prev_content:
    description: Optional. The previous `content` for this event. If there is no
      previous content, this key will be missing.
    title: EventContent
    type: object
  state_key:
    description: A unique key which defines the overwriting semantics for this piece
      of room state. This value is often a zero-length string. The presence of this
      key makes this event a State Event.

      State keys starting with an `@` are reserved for referencing user IDs, such
      as room members. With the exception of a few events, state events set with a
      given user's ID as the state key MUST only be set by that user.
