title: UnsignedData
type: object
description: Contains optional extra information about the event.
properties:
  age:
    description: The time in milliseconds that has elapsed since the event was
      sent. This field is generated by the local homeserver, and may be incorrect
      if the local time on at least one of the two servers is out of sync, which can
      cause the age to either be negative or greater than it actually is.
    type: integer
  redacted_because:
    description: The event that redacted this event, if any.
    title: Event
    type: object
  transaction_id:
    description: |
      The client-supplied transaction ID, for example, provided via
      `PUT /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}`,
      if the client being given the event is the same one which sent it.
    type: string
  prev_content:
    description: |
      The previous `content` for this event. This field is generated
      by the local homeserver, and is only returned if the event is a state event,
      and the client has permission to see the previous content.
    x-changedInMatrixVersion:
      1.2: |
        Previously, this field was specified at the top level of returned
        events rather than in `unsigned` (with the exception of the [`GET
        .../notifications`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3notifications)
        endpoint), though in practice no known server implementations honoured
        this.
