  This event type is used to indicate new Olm sessions for end-to-end encryption.
  Typically it is encrypted as an `m.room.encrypted` event, then sent as a [to-device](/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging)
  event.

  The event does not have any content associated with it. The sending client is expected
  to send a key share request shortly after this message, causing the receiving client to
  process this `m.dummy` event as the most recent event and using the keyshare request
  to set up the session. The keyshare request and `m.dummy` combination should result
  in the original sending client receiving keys over the newly established session.
