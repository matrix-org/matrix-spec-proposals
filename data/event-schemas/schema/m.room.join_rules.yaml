  A room may have one of the following designations:
  * `public` - anyone can join the room without any prior action.
  * `invite` - a user must first receive an invite from someone already in the room
    in order to join.
  * `knock` - a user can request an invite to the room. They can be allowed (invited)
    or denied (kicked/banned) access. Otherwise, users need to be invited in. Only
    available in rooms [which support knocking](/rooms/#feature-matrix).
  * `restricted` - anyone able to satisfy at least one of the allow conditions is
    able to join the room without prior action. Otherwise, an invite is required.
    Only available in rooms [which support the join rule](/rooms/#feature-matrix).
  * `private` - reserved without implementation. No significant meaning.

          For `restricted` rooms, the conditions the user will be tested against. The
          user needs only to satisfy one of the conditions to join the `restricted`
          room. If the user fails to meet any condition, or the condition is unable
          to be confirmed as satisfied, then the user requires an invite to join the
          room. Improper or no `allow` conditions on a `restricted` join rule imply
          the room is effectively invite-only (no conditions can be satisfied).

                satisfy the condition and thus are permitted to join the `restricted`
                room.
