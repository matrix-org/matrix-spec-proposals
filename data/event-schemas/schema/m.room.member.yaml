  Adjusts the membership state for a user in a room. It is preferable to use the membership APIs (`/rooms/<room id>/invite` etc) when performing membership actions rather than adjusting the state directly as there are a restricted set of valid transformations. For example, user A cannot force user B to join a room, and trying to force this state change directly will fail.

  The following membership states are specified:

  - `invite` - The user has been invited to join a room, but has not yet joined it. They may not participate in the room until they join.

  - `join` - The user has joined the room (possibly after accepting an invite), and may participate in it.

  - `leave` - The user was once joined to the room, but has since left (possibly by choice, or possibly by being kicked).

  - `ban` - The user has been banned from the room, and is no longer allowed to join it until they are un-banned from the room (by having their membership state set to a value other than `ban`).

  - `knock` - The user has knocked on the room, requesting permission to participate. They may not participate in the room until they join.

  The `third_party_invite` property will be set if this invite is an `invite` event and is the successor of an `m.room.third_party_invite` event, and absent otherwise.

  This event may also include an `invite_room_state` key inside the event's `unsigned` data.
  If present, this contains an array of [stripped state events](/client-server-api/#stripped-state)
  to assist the receiver in identifying the room.

  The user for which a membership applies is represented by the `state_key`. Under some conditions,
  the `sender` and `state_key` may not match - this may be interpreted as the `sender` affecting
  the membership state of the `state_key` user.

  The `membership` for a given user can change over time. The table below represents the various changes
  over time and how clients and servers must interpret those changes. Previous membership can be retrieved
  from the `prev_content` object on an event. If not present, the user's previous membership must be assumed
  as `leave`.

          Usually found on `join` events, this field is used to denote which homeserver (through representation of a user with sufficient power level)
          authorised the user's join. More information about this field can be found in the [Restricted Rooms Specification](#restricted-rooms).

          Client and server implementations should be aware of the [signing implications](/rooms/v8/#authorization-rules) of including this
          field in further events: in particular, the event must be signed by the server which
          owns the user ID in the field. When copying the membership event's `content` 
          (for profile updates and similar) it is therefore encouraged to exclude this
          field in the copy, as otherwise the event might fail event authorization.

        description: |-
          Optional user-supplied text for why their membership has changed. For kicks and bans, this is typically the reason for the kick or ban.
          For other membership changes, this is a way for the user to communicate their intent without having to send a message to the room, such
          as in a case where Bob rejects an invite from Alice about an upcoming concert, but can't make it that day.

          Clients are not recommended to show this reason to users when receiving an invite due to the potential for spam and abuse. Hiding the
          reason behind a button or other component is recommended.
