      summary: Notify a push gateway about an event.
      description: |-
        This endpoint is invoked by HTTP pushers to notify a push gateway about
        an event or update the number of unread notifications a user has.
        In the former case it will contain selected information about the event.
        In either case it may contain numeric counts of the number of unread
        events of different types the user has. The counts may be sent along
        with a notification about an event or by themselves.

        Notifications about a particular event will normally cause the user to be
        alerted in some way. It is therefore necessary to perform duplicate
        suppression for such notifications using the `event_id` field to avoid
        retries of this HTTP API causing duplicate alerts. The operation of
        updating counts of unread notifications should be idempotent and
        therefore do not require duplicate suppression.

        Notifications are sent to the URL configured when the pusher is created.
        This means that the HTTP path may be different depending on the push
        gateway.
