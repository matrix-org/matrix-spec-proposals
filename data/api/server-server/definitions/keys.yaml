properties:
  server_name:
    type: string
    description: DNS name of the homeserver.
    example: "example.org"
  verify_keys:
    type: object
    description: |-
      Public keys of the homeserver for verifying digital signatures.

      The object's key is the algorithm and version combined (`ed25519` being the
      algorithm and `abc123` being the version in the example below). Together,
      this forms the Key ID. The version must have characters matching the regular
      expression `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.

  old_verify_keys:
    type: object
    description: |-
      The public keys that the server used to use and when it stopped using them.

      The object's key is the algorithm and version combined (`ed25519` being the
      algorithm and `0ldK3y` being the version in the example below). Together,
      this forms the Key ID. The version must have characters matching the regular
      expression `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.

  signatures:

    description: |-
      Digital signatures for this object signed using the `verify_keys`.

      The signature is calculated using the process described at [Signing JSON](/appendices/#signing-json).

      additionalProperties:
        type: string
  valid_until_ts:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: |-
      POSIX timestamp when the list of valid keys should be refreshed. This field MUST
      be ignored in room versions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Keys used beyond this timestamp MUST
      be considered invalid, depending on the [room version specification](/rooms).

      Servers MUST use the lesser of this field and 7 days into the future when
      determining if a key is valid. This is to avoid a situation where an attacker
      publishes a key which is valid for a significant amount of time without a way
      for the homeserver owner to revoke it.
