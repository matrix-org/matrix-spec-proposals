                  Key ID to query for the particular server. If no key IDs are given
                  to be queried, the notary server should query for all keys. If no
                  servers are given, the notary server must return an empty `server_keys`
                  array in the response.

                  The notary server may return multiple keys regardless of the Key IDs
                  given.
