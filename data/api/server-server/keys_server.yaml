      summary: Get the homeserver's public key(s)
      description: |-
        Gets the homeserver's published signing keys.
        The homeserver may have any number of active keys and may have a
        number of old keys.

        Intermediate notary servers should cache a response for half of its
        lifetime to avoid serving a stale response. Originating servers should
        avoid returning responses that expire in less than an hour to avoid
        repeated requests for a certificate that is about to expire. Requesting
        servers should limit how frequently they query for certificates to
        avoid flooding a server with requests.

        If the server fails to respond to this request, intermediate notary
        servers should continue to return the last response they received
        from the server so that the signatures of old events can still be
        checked.
