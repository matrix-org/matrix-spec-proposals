      description: |-
        Gets information about the delegated server for server-server communication
        between Matrix homeservers. Servers should follow 30x redirects, carefully
        avoiding redirect loops, and use normal X.509 certificate validation.

          description:
            The delegated server information. The `Content-Type` for this response SHOULD
            be `application/json`, however servers parsing the response should assume that
            the body is JSON regardless of type. Failures parsing the JSON or invalid data
            provided in the resulting parsed JSON should not result in discovery failure -
            consult the server discovery process for information on how to continue.
          examples:
            application/json: {
              "m.server": "delegated.example.com:1234"

                description: |-
                  The server name to delegate server-server communications to, with optional
                  port. The delegated server name uses the same grammar as
                  [server names in the appendices](/appendices/#server-name).
