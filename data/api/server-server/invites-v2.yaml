      summary: Invites a remote user to a room
      description: |-
        **Note:**
        This API is nearly identical to the v1 API with the exception of the request
        body being different, and the response format fixed.

        Invites a remote user to a room. Once the event has been  signed by both the inviting
        homeserver and the invited homeserver, it can be sent to all of the servers in the
        room by the inviting homeserver.

        This endpoint is preferred over the v1 API as it is more useful for servers. Senders
        which receive a 400 or 404 response to this endpoint should retry using the v1
        API as the server may be older, if the room version is "1" or "2".

        Note that events have a different format depending on the room version - check the
        [room version specification](/rooms) for precise event formats. **The request and response
        bodies here describe the common event fields in more detail and may be missing other
        required fields for a PDU.**

            The invite is not allowed. This could be for a number of reasons, including:

            * The sender is not allowed to send invites to the target user/homeserver.
            * The homeserver does not permit anyone to invite its users.
            * The homeserver refuses to participate in the room.
