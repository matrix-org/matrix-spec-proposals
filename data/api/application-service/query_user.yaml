      description: |-
        This endpoint is invoked by the homeserver on an application service to query
        the existence of a given user ID. The homeserver will only query user IDs
        inside the application service's `users` namespace. The homeserver will
        send this request when it receives an event for an unknown user ID in
        the application service's namespace, such as a room invite.
