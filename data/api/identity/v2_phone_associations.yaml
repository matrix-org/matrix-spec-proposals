      summary: Request a token for validating a phone number.
      description: |-
        Create a session for validating a phone number.

        The identity server will send an SMS message containing a token. If
        that token is presented to the identity server in the future, it
        indicates that that user was able to read the SMS for that phone
        number, and so we validate ownership of the phone number.

        Note that homeservers offer APIs that proxy this API, adding
        additional behaviour on top, for example,
        `/register/msisdn/requestToken` is designed specifically for use when
        registering an account and therefore will inform the user if the phone
        number given is already registered on the server.

        Note: for backwards compatibility with previous drafts of this
        specification, the parameters may also be specified as
        `application/x-form-www-urlencoded` data. However, this usage is
        deprecated.

            An error occurred. Some possible errors are:

            - `M_INVALID_ADDRESS`: The phone number provided was invalid.
            - `M_SEND_ERROR`: The validation SMS could not be sent.
            - `M_DESTINATION_REJECTED`: The identity server cannot deliver an
              SMS to the provided country or region.
          examples:
            application/json: {
              "errcode": "M_INVALID_ADDRESS",

      description: |-
        Validate ownership of a phone number.

        If the three parameters are consistent with a set generated by a
        `requestToken` call, ownership of the phone number is considered to
        have been validated. This does not publish any information publicly, or
        associate the phone number address with any Matrix user
        ID. Specifically, calls to `/lookup` will not show a binding.

        The identity server is free to match the token case-insensitively, or
        carry out other mapping operations such as unicode
        normalisation. Whether to do so is an implementation detail for the
        identity server. Clients must always pass on the token without
        modification.

        Note: for backwards compatibility with previous drafts of this
        specification, the parameters may also be specified as
        `application/x-form-www-urlencoded` data. However, this usage is
        deprecated.
