      summary: Request a token for validating an email address.
      description: |-
        Create a session for validating an email address.

        The identity server will send an email containing a token. If that
        token is presented to the identity server in the future, it indicates
        that that user was able to read the email for that email address, and
        so we validate ownership of the email address.

        Note that homeservers offer APIs that proxy this API, adding
        additional behaviour on top, for example,
        `/register/email/requestToken` is designed specifically for use when
        registering an account and therefore will inform the user if the email
        address given is already registered on the server.

        Note: for backwards compatibility with previous drafts of this
        specification, the parameters may also be specified as
        `application/x-form-www-urlencoded` data.  However, this usage is
        deprecated.

            An error occurred.  Some possible errors are:

            - `M_INVALID_EMAIL`: The email address provided was invalid.
            - `M_EMAIL_SEND_ERROR`: The validation email could not be sent.

      summary: Validate ownership of an email address.
      description: |-
        Validate ownership of an email address.

        If the three parameters are consistent with a set generated by a
        `requestToken` call, ownership of the email address is considered to
        have been validated. This does not publish any information publicly, or
        associate the email address with any Matrix user ID. Specifically,
        calls to `/lookup` will not show a binding.

        The identity server is free to match the token case-insensitively, or
        carry out other mapping operations such as unicode
        normalisation. Whether to do so is an implementation detail for the
        identity server. Clients must always pass on the token without
        modification.

        Note: for backwards compatibility with previous drafts of this
        specification, the parameters may also be specified as
        `application/x-form-www-urlencoded` data.  However, this usage is
