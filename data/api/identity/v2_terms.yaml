        Gets all the terms of service offered by the server. The client is expected
        to filter through the terms to determine which terms need acceptance from the
        user. Note that this endpoint does not require authentication.

                          in it, to be presented to the user as the policy. URLs should have
                          all three criteria to avoid conflicts when the policy is updated
                          in the future: for example, if this was "https://example.org/terms.html"
                          then the server would be unable to update it because the client would
                          have already added that URL to the ``m.accepted_terms`` collection.

      summary: Indicates acceptance of terms to the server.
      description: |-
        Called by a client to indicate that the user has accepted/agreed to the included
        set of URLs. Servers MUST NOT assume that the client will be sending all previously
        accepted URLs and should therefore append the provided URLs to what the server
        already knows has been accepted.

        Clients MUST provide the URL of the policy in the language that was presented
        to the user. Servers SHOULD consider acceptance of any one language's URL as
        acceptance for all other languages of that policy.

        The server should avoid returning ``M_TERMS_NOT_SIGNED`` because the client
        may not be accepting all terms at once.
