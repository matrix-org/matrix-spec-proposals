        Invalidates an existing access token, so that it can no longer be used for

      summary: Invalidates all access tokens for a user
      description: |-
        Invalidates all access tokens for a user, so that they can no longer be used for
        authorization. This includes the access token that made this request. All devices
        for the user are also deleted. [Device keys](/client-server-api/#device-keys) for the device are
        deleted alongside the device.

        This endpoint does not use the [User-Interactive Authentication API](/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api) because
        User-Interactive Authentication is designed to protect against attacks where the
        someone gets hold of a single access token then takes over the account. This
        endpoint invalidates all access tokens for the user, including the token used in
        the request, and therefore the attacker is unable to take over the account in
        this way.
