      summary: Get events and state around the specified event.
      description: |-
        This API returns a number of events that happened just before and
        after the specified event. This allows clients to get the context
        surrounding an event.

        *Note*: This endpoint supports lazy-loading of room member events. See
        `Lazy-loading room members <#lazy-loading-room-members>`_ for more information.

            A JSON ``RoomEventFilter`` to filter the returned events with. The
            filter is only applied to ``events_before``, ``events_after``, and
            ``state``. It is not applied to the ``event`` itself. The filter may 
            be applied before or/and after the ``limit`` parameter - whichever the 
            homeserver prefers.

            See `Filtering <#filtering>`_ for more information.
