      description: |-
        This endpoint is the same as `/login/sso/redirect`, though with an
        IdP ID from the original `identity_providers` array to inform the
        server of which IdP the client/user would like to continue with.

        The server MUST respond with an HTTP redirect to the SSO interface
        for that IdP.
