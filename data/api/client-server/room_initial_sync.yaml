        Get a copy of the current state and the most recent messages in a room.

        This endpoint was deprecated in r0 of this specification. There is no
        direct replacement; the relevant information is returned by the
        [`/sync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync) API. See the
        [migration guide](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/migrating-from-client-server-api-v-1#deprecated-endpoints).
