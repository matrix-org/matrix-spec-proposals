      summary: Get a list of events for this room
      description: |-
        This API returns a list of message and state events for a room. It uses
        pagination query parameters to paginate history in the room.

        *Note*: This endpoint supports lazy-loading of room member events. See
        [Lazy-loading room members](/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members) for more information.
      operationId: getRoomEvents

        - in: query
          type: string
          name: from
          description: |-
            The token to start returning events from. This token can be obtained
            from a `prev_batch` or `next_batch` token returned by the `/sync` endpoint,
            or from an `end` token returned by a previous request to this endpoint.

            This endpoint can also accept a value returned as a `start` token
            by a previous request to this endpoint, though servers are not
            required to support this. Clients should not rely on the behaviour.
          required: true
          x-example: "s345_678_333"

            The token to stop returning events at. This token can be obtained from
            a `prev_batch` or `next_batch` token returned by the `/sync` endpoint,
            or from an `end` token returned by a previous request to this endpoint.

          name: dir
          description: |-
            The direction to return events from. If this is set to `f`, events
            will be returned in chronological order starting at `from`. If it
            is set to `b`, events will be returned in *reverse* chronological
            order, again starting at `from`.
          required: true
          x-example: "b"
        - in: query
          type: integer
          name: limit
          description: |-
            The maximum number of events to return. Default: 10.

            properties:
              start:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  A token corresponding to the start of `chunk`. This will be the same as
                  the value given in `from`.
              end:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  A token corresponding to the end of `chunk`. This token can be passed
                  back to this endpoint to request further events.

                  If no further events are available (either because we have
                  reached the start of the timeline, or because the user does
                  not have permission to see any more events), this property
                  is omitted from the response.
              chunk:
                type: array
                description: |-
                  A list of room events. The order depends on the `dir` parameter.
                  For `dir=b` events will be in reverse-chronological order,
                  for `dir=f` in chronological order. (The exact definition of `chronological`
                  is dependent on the server implementation.)

                  Note that an empty `chunk` does not *necessarily* imply that no more events
                  are available. Clients should continue to paginate until no `end` property
                  is returned.
                items:
                  "$ref": "definitions/client_event.yaml"
              state:
                type: array
                description: |-
                  A list of state events relevant to showing the `chunk`. For example, if
                  `lazy_load_members` is enabled in the filter then this may contain
                  the membership events for the senders of events in the `chunk`.

                  Unless `include_redundant_members` is `true`, the server
                  may remove membership events which would have already been
                  sent to the client in prior calls to this endpoint, assuming
                  the membership of those members has not changed.
