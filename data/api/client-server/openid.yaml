      summary: Get an OpenID token object to verify the requester's identity.
      description: |-
        Gets an OpenID token object that the requester may supply to another
        service to verify their identity in Matrix. The generated token is only
        valid for exchanging for user information from the federation API for
        OpenID.

        The access token generated is only valid for the OpenID API. It cannot
        be used to request another OpenID access token or call `/sync`, for
        example.

            OpenID token information. This response is nearly compatible with the
            response documented in the
            [OpenID Connect 1.0 Specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenResponse)
            with the only difference being the lack of an `id_token`. Instead,
            the Matrix homeserver's name is provided.
