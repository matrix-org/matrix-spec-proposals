      summary: Query if a given registration token is still valid.
      description: |-
        Queries the server to determine if a given registration token is still
        valid at the time of request. This is a point-in-time check where the
        token might still expire by the time it is used.

        Servers should be sure to rate limit this endpoint to avoid brute force
        attacks.

                  True if the token is still valid, false otherwise. This should
