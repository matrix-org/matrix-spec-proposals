      summary: |-
        Updates a room's visibility in the application service's room directory.
      description: |-
        Updates the visibility of a given room on the application service's room
        directory.

        This API is similar to the room directory visibility API used by clients
        to update the homeserver's more general room directory.

        This API requires the use of an application service access token (`as_token`)
        instead of a typical client's access_token. This API cannot be invoked by
        users who are not identified as application services.

            have been provided by the application service as being listed as
            a supported protocol.
