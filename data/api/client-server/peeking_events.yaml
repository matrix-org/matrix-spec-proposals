      description: |-
        This will listen for new events related to a particular room and return
        them to the caller. This will block until an event is received, or until
        the ``timeout`` is reached.

        This API is the same as the normal ``/events`` endpoint, but can be
        called by users who have not joined the room.

        Note that the normal ``/events`` endpoint has been deprecated. This
        API will also be deprecated at some point, but its replacement is not
        yet known.
