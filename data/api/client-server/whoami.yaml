      description: |-
        Gets information about the owner of a given access token.

        Note that, as with the rest of the Client-Server API,
        Application Services may masquerade as users within their
        namespace by giving a `user_id` query parameter. In this
        situation, the server should verify that the given `user_id`
        is registered by the appservice, and return it in the response
        body.

                  Device ID associated with the access token. If no device
                  is associated with the access token (such as in the case
                  of application services) then this field can be omitted.
                  Otherwise this is required.

                  When `true`, the user is a [Guest User](#guest-access). When
                  not present or `false`, the user is presumed to be a non-guest
                  user.
