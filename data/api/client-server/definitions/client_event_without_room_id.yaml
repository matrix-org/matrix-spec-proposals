    type: string
    example: '$26RqwJMLw-yds1GAH_QxjHRC1Da9oasK0e5VLnck_45'
  type:
    description: The type of the event.
    type: string
    example: 'm.room.member'
  state_key:
    description: |-
      Present if, and only if, this event is a *state* event. The key making
      this piece of state unique in the room. Note that it is often an empty

  sender:
    description: Contains the fully-qualified ID of the user who sent this event.
    type: string
    example: "@example:example.org"
  origin_server_ts:
    description: |-
      Timestamp (in milliseconds since the unix epoch) on originating homeserver
      when this event was sent.
    type: integer
    format: int64
    example: 1632489532305

    description: Contains optional extra information about the event.
    properties:
      age:
        description: The time in milliseconds that has elapsed since the event was
          sent. This field is generated by the local homeserver, and may be incorrect
          if the local time on at least one of the two servers is out of sync, which can
          cause the age to either be negative or greater than it actually is.
        type: integer
        format: int64
        example: 1567437
      redacted_because:

        example: {
          "type": "m.room.redaction",
          "sender": "@moderator:example.org",
          "content": {
            "reason": "spam"
          },
          "redacts": "$26RqwJMLw-yds1GAH_QxjHRC1Da9oasK0e5VLnck_45",
          "event_id": "$Nhl3rsgHMjk-DjMJANawr9HHAhLg4GcoTYrSiYYGqEE",

          The client-supplied transaction ID, for example, provided via
          `PUT /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}`,
          if the client being given the event is the same one which sent it.
        type: string
      prev_content:
        description: |
          The previous `content` for this event. This field is generated
          by the local homeserver, and is only returned if the event is a state event,
          and the client has permission to see the previous content.
        x-changedInMatrixVersion:
          1.2: |
            Previously, this field was specified at the top level of returned
            events rather than in `unsigned` (with the exception of the [`GET
            .../notifications`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3notifications)
            endpoint), though in practice no known server implementations honoured
            this.
