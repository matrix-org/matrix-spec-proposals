  identity_providers:
    type: array
    description: |-
      Optional identity providers (IdPs) to present to the user. These would
      appear (typically) as distinct buttons for the user to interact with,
      and would map to the appropriate IdP-dependent redirect endpoint for that
      IdP.
    example: [
      {"id": "com.example.idp.github", "name": "GitHub", "brand": "github"},
      {"id": "com.example.idp.gitlab", "name": "GitLab", "icon": "mxc://example.com/abc123"},

      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Opaque string chosen by the homeserver, uniquely identifying
            the IdP from other IdPs the homeserver might support. Should
            be between 1 and 255 characters in length, containing unreserved
            characters under [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt)
            (`ALPHA  DIGIT  "-" / "." / "_" / "~"`). Clients are not intended
            to parse or infer meaning from opaque strings.
          example: "com.example.idp.github"
        name:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Human readable description for the IdP, intended to be shown to
            the user.
          example: "Github"
        icon:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Optional MXC URI to provide an image/icon representing the IdP.
            Intended to be shown alongside the `name` if provided.
          example: "mxc://example.org/abc123"
        brand:
          type: string
          # TODO @@TR: Actually link to "common identifier format" section when it exists.
          description: |-
            Optional UI hint for what kind of common SSO provider is being
            described in this IdP. Matrix maintains a registry of identifiers
            [in the matrix-doc repo](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/informal/idp-brands.md)
            to ensure clients and servers are aligned on major/common brands.

            Clients should prefer the `brand` over the `icon`, when both are
            provided. Clients are not required to support any particular `brand`,
            including those in the registry, though are expected to be able to
            present any IdP based off the `name`/`icon` to the user regardless.

            Unregistered brands are permitted using the Standard Identifier Format,
            though excluding the namespace requirements. For example, `examplesso`
            is a valid brand which is not in the registry but still permitted.
            Servers should be mindful that clients might not support their unregistered
            brand usage as intended by the server.
          example: "github"
      required: ['id', 'name']

required: ['type']
