      summary: Knock on a room, requesting permission to join.
      description: |-
        *Note that this API takes either a room ID or alias, unlike other membership APIs.*

        This API "knocks" on the room to ask for permission to join, if the user
        is allowed to knock on the room. Acceptance of the knock happens out of
        band from this API, meaning that the client will have to watch for updates
        regarding the acceptance/rejection of the knock.

        If the room history settings allow, the user will still be able to see
        history of the room while being in the "knock" state. The user will have
        to accept the invitation to join the room (acceptance of knock) to see
        messages reliably. See the `/join` endpoints for more information about
        history visibility to the user.

        The knock will appear as an entry in the response of the
        [`/sync`](/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync) API.

            The room has been knocked upon.

            The knocked room ID must be returned in the `room_id` field.

            You do not have permission to knock on the room. A meaningful `errcode`
            and description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection are:

            - The room is not set up for knocking.
            - The user has been banned from the room.
          examples:
            application/json: {
              "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN", "error": "You are not allowed to knock on this room."
            }
