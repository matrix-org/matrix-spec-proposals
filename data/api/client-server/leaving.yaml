      description: |-
        This API stops a user participating in a particular room.

        If the user was already in the room, they will no longer be able to see
        new events in the room. If the room requires an invite to join, they
        will need to be re-invited before they can re-join.

        If the user was invited to the room, but had not joined, this call
        serves to reject the invite.

        The user will still be allowed to retrieve history from the room which
        they were previously allowed to see.

      description: |-
        This API stops a user remembering about a particular room.

        In general, history is a first class citizen in Matrix. After this API
        is called, however, a user will no longer be able to retrieve history
        for this room. If all users on a homeserver forget a room, the room is
        eligible for deletion from that homeserver.

        If the user is currently joined to the room, they must leave the room
        before calling this API.
