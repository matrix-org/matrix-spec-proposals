        Gets a list of the third party identifiers that the homeserver has
        associated with the user's account.

        This is *not* the same as the list of third party identifiers bound to
        the user's Matrix ID in identity servers.

        Identifiers in this list may be used by the homeserver as, for example,
        identifiers that it will accept to reset the user's account password.

        This endpoint is deprecated in favour of the more specific `/3pid/add`
        and `/3pid/bind` endpoints.

        **Note:**
        Previously this endpoint supported a `bind` parameter. This parameter
        has been removed, making this endpoint behave as though it was `false`.
        This results in this endpoint being an equivalent to `/3pid/bind` rather
        than dual-purpose.
