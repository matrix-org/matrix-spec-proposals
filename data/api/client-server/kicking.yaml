        Kick a user from the room.

        The caller must have the required power level in order to perform this operation.

        Kicking a user adjusts the target member's membership state to be `leave` with an
        optional `reason`. Like with other membership changes, a user can directly adjust
        the target member's state by making a request to `/rooms/<room id>/state/m.room.member/<user id>`.

            You do not have permission to kick the user from the room. A meaningful `errcode` and
            description error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejections are:

            - The kicker is not currently in the room.
            - The kickee is not currently in the room.
            - The kicker's power level is insufficient to kick users from the room.
          examples:
            application/json: {
                "errcode": "M_FORBIDDEN",
                "error": "You do not have a high enough power level to kick from this room."
