      description: |
        State events can be sent using this endpoint.  These events will be
        overwritten if `<room id>`, `<event type>` and `<state key>` all
        match.

        Requests to this endpoint **cannot use transaction IDs**
        like other `PUT` paths because they cannot be differentiated from the
        `state_key`. Furthermore, `POST` is unsupported on state paths.

        The body of the request should be the content object of the event; the
        fields in this object will vary depending on the type of event. See
        [Room Events](/client-server-api/#room-events) for the `m.` event specification.

        If the event type being sent is `m.room.canonical_alias` servers
        SHOULD ensure that any new aliases being listed in the event are valid
        per their grammar/syntax and that they point to the room ID where the
        state event is to be sent. Servers do not validate aliases which are
        being removed or are already present in the state event.
