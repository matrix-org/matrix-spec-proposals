# GHA workflow which publishes previews of spec PRs to netlify.
#
# We keep this in a separate workflow to the main spec build, because it
# requires access to the Netlify secret. By having it run on `workflow_run`, we
# will only use the workflow definition file on the default branch, so we can
# ensure that the secret can't be exfiltrated.
