# Spec diagrams

Non-ascii diagrams for the spec can be placed here for reference in the actual spec.
Please include source material so the diagram can be recreated by a future editor.

https://www.diagrams.net/ is a great ([open source](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio))
tool for these sorts of things - include your `.drawio` file next to your diagram.

Suggested settings for diagrams.net:
* Export as PNG.
* 100% size.
* `20` for a border width.
* No transparent background, shadow, or grid.
* Include a copy of the diagram.

To reference a diagram, use the absolute path when compiled. For example,
`![membership-flow-diagram](/diagrams/membership.png)`
