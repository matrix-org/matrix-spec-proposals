# {{ page.title }}
An instant messaging application written specifically for the matrix protocol to take advantage of its modern features. Designed to be lightweight but not dependent on fast Internet: the state is stored locally so you don't have to wait every time you open it. Highly versatile notification options keep you informed without getting distracted.
While it's still in early stages and far from feature-complete, the chat window has taken shape, feel free to try it out and give us feedback and feature requests.
The project is hosted on [github](https://github.com/koma-im/koma).
