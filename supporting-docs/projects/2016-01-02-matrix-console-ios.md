Matrix.org's reference iOS client.

This client is meant to be a showcase of Matrix capabilities, a reference implementation of the Matrix standard and an easy entry to the Matrix ecosystem from iOS devices for less techy users,  with a relatively neutral branding. This client is built using [MatrixKit](http://matrix.org/blog/project/matrix-ios-matrixkit/).

The code can be retrieved from [github](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-console).

Also available from the Apple [app store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271?mt=8).
