# {{ page.title }}
This project bridges between matrix and telegram.

Telegram users can now participate in matrix rooms, while choosing
which room to "focus" (send and receive messages) at a time.
Our goal is to provide full matrix user experience, including support of
all media types, relaying "typing..." messages, etc..

Find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/GalPressman/matrigram/).
