Liveblogging is reporting about events -- with text and pictures -- as they happen. Matrix is a new, powerful messaging platform for instant communication. We believe the two belong together. That's why we have created Matrix Live.

With Matrix Live, you can create a room in Matrix, and while you use your favorite Matrix client (such as Riot) to write text and post pictures in this room, your users will see them appear live on the web - either here or right on your blog or website.

How does it look like in practice? You can try it out. We have prepared two demo versions for you, which are both fully functional Matrix Live implementations - check them out [here](https://live.hello-matrix.net/live.html#matrix.hello-matrix.net/!sBcCeweWXOjVViEiIY%3Ahello-matrix.net/Hello%2C%20Matrix!) and [here](https://live.hello-matrix.net/demo2.html).
