# {{ page.title }}
[matrix-react-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk) is our next-generation Web SDK for Matrix, providing both a large hierarchy of reusable UI components and a simple neutral reference application. It's suitable both for building standalone applications and embedding Matrix clients into existing web apps, irrespective of the host app's framework.
