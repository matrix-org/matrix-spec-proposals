# {{ page.title }}
Navi is a tiny bot for Matrix that sends notifications to users. It is builtupon the [Matrix Python SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk).

The motivation behind Navi is to send notifications from anywhere to everywhere. This includes the push services GCM and APNs that [Riot](https://riot.im/) bridges to, without having to rely on services such as Pushbullet or Pushover.

The first time you use it, Navi creates a new room and invites your user to it. The room will be reused afterwards. If you leave the room, so will Navi, and invite you to a new room.

Follow the progress and grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/madmax28/navi)!
