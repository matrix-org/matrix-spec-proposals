# {{ page.title }}
Perpetually Talking Online (PTO) is an IRC frontend to the federated Matrix network. It aims to enable as many people as possible to use an existing Matrix homeserver with their existing IRC clients, and provides a radically expanded feature set for existing IRC communities looking to migrate to Matrix.

See [pto.im](http://pto.im) for more info - or grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/tdfischer/pto).

Unfortunately, it appears that this project is no longer being worked on. Check out [matrix-ircd](./matrix-ircd.html) instead!
